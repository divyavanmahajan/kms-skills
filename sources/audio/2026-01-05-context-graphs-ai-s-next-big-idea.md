# Context Graphs: AI's Next Big Idea

## Overview

This episode of the **AI Daily Brief** (recorded January 5, 2026) explores the emerging concept of **context graphs** — a proposed new layer of organizational data infrastructure designed to make AI agents more effective at complex enterprise work. The host argues that the key bottleneck for autonomous AI agents is not model capability or even data access, but the absence of captured decision rationale — the "why" behind organizational choices. The episode synthesizes three recent essays by investors and executives: Jameen Ball's *Long Live Systems of Record*, Jay Gupta and Ashut Garg's (Foundation Capital) *AI's Trillion-Dollar Opportunity: Context Graphs*, and Aaron Levy's (Box) *The Era of Context*.

The episode also covers AI headlines including new AI wearables at CES, early AI cancer diagnostics in China, Grok's content moderation controversy, and Yann LeCun's public criticisms of Meta's AI strategy.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of **large language models (LLMs)** and **AI agents**
- Familiarity with enterprise software concepts: CRM systems (e.g., Salesforce), ERP/finance tools (e.g., NetSuite), ticketing systems (e.g., Zendesk), data warehouses and data lakehouses
- General awareness of the **agentic AI** trend — AI systems that take autonomous actions across tools and workflows
- Familiarity with **knowledge graphs** as a concept in data engineering

---

## Main Points

### 1. AI Wearables Return at CES 2026 (Headlines)
- The 2025 AI wearable cohort (Humane AI Pin, Rabbit R1, Limitless Pendant, Friend) largely failed commercially
- New devices at CES include **Plaud NotePin S** ($179), which adds a physical button to reduce recording friction, and **SwitchBot MindClip** (18g, no pricing announced), pitched as a "second brain" for voice notes
- The new generation focuses narrowly on AI note-taking rather than broader ambient computing
- The host is skeptical but notes companies may be rushing to market ahead of anticipated **OpenAI hardware** (expected 2027)

### 2. AI Cancer Diagnostics in China (Headlines)
- A Chinese hospital running a clinical trial since November 2024 has used AI to screen **180,000 routine CT scans** for tumors
- Approximately 24 cases of pancreatic cancer detected; ~14 caught at early stages — patients who were in hospital for unrelated complaints
- Pancreatic cancer has a 5-year survival rate of ~10% due to difficulty of early detection; AI screening does not require radioactive dyes, making wider screening feasible
- The overseeing physician stated: *"I think you can 100% say AI saved their lives."*

### 3. Grok Moderation Controversy (Headlines)
- Grok (xAI) appears to have rolled back safeguards that previously rejected requests to undress images of real people
- France, Malaysia, and India have condemned xAI; India's IT ministry issued a formal order to restrict generation of explicit content
- Examples included partial undressing of a 14-year-old actress; Elon Musk posted that users generating illegal content will face consequences but has not addressed the policy rollback directly
- An xAI employee acknowledged the issue and said the team is "looking into further tightening guardrails"

### 4. Yann LeCun's Departure from Meta and New Venture (Headlines)
- LeCun, longtime head of Meta AI, departed after a leadership restructuring and criticised new Meta AI CEO **Alexander Wang** as "young and inexperienced" in research practice
- LeCun described Meta's new superintelligence team as "completely LLM-pilled," calling LLMs "basically a dead end when it comes to superintelligence"
- He disclosed that **Llama 4** "fudged the benchmarks a little bit"
- His new company is **Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs**, targeting a $3B valuation; co-founder and CEO is **Alex Lebrun** (founder of Nabla)
- The host endorses the view (via Dr. Kareem Carr) that LeCun's opposition to LLM dominance provides healthy scientific friction for the field

### 5. The Systems of Record Problem (Main Episode)
- Essay by investor **Jameen Ball** (*Long Live Systems of Record*) establishes the foundational problem: in any large organization, the same metric (e.g., ARR) may have different canonical values depending on which team and system you ask
- As workflows become agent-driven, the fragility point shifts to **data governance** — which system owns which truth, and what the contract between those truths is
- Prior solutions (data warehouses, lakehouses) lived "downstream" of operations — they were retrospective mirrors, not transactional systems; operational teams still worked in their native tools
- Agents are **cross-system and action-oriented**, meaning they don't just retrieve data — they act on it across multiple domains simultaneously, making data canonicality critical

### 6. The Missing Layer: Decision Traces
- Essay by **Jay Gupta and Ashut Garg** (Foundation Capital) argues that Ball's framing addresses only half the problem: it assumes the data agents need already exists somewhere
- The missing layer is **decision traces** — the record of exceptions, overrides, approvals, and cross-system synthesis that currently lives in Slack threads, verbal conversations, and human memory
- The key distinction is the **what vs. why gap**:
  - *Systems of record* capture state: "This deal closed at a 20% discount"
  - *Decision traces* capture lineage: "Why a 20% discount was approved in this case"
- Categories of missing decision trace information:
  - **Exception logic in people's heads**: e.g., "We always give healthcare companies 10% extra because their procurement cycles are brutal" — not in the CRM
  - **Precedent from past decisions**: "We did something similar for Company X last quarter; we should be consistent"
  - **Cross-system synthesis**: A human reads Salesforce data, a Zendesk escalation, and a Slack thread, synthesizes them internally, and records only "escalated to tier 3"
  - **Informal approval chains**: A manager gives a verbal thumbs-up on a discount; only the final price is recorded, not who approved the deviation or why

### 7. What a Context Graph Is
- A **context graph** is the accumulated sum of captured decision traces — a queryable record of how decisions were made, stitched across entities and time
- Agents that sit in the execution path naturally see the full context at decision time: what inputs were gathered, what policy was evaluated, what exception route was invoked, who approved, and what state was written
- If those traces are persisted, the result is a **living record of organizational decision-making** that does not currently exist in most enterprises
- Example workflow:
  - A renewal agent proposes a 20% discount
  - Policy caps renewals at 10% unless a service-impact exemption applies
  - The agent pulls three SEV-1 incidents from PagerDuty, an open "cancel unless fixed" escalation in Zendesk, and a prior Slack thread showing a VP approved a similar exemption
  - Finance approves; the CRM records "20% discount"
  - The context graph records all of the decision rationale behind that outcome
- Over time, captured traces become **searchable precedent**, and every automated decision adds another trace — creating a compounding feedback loop

### 8. Designing Context Graphs: Don't Pre-Constrain the Structure
- The **Cogent Enterprise Substack** argues that context graphs should not be pre-defined with a fixed schema (as traditional knowledge graphs require)
- Agents acting as "informed walkers" through the decision landscape **discover the organizational ontology on the fly** — learning which entities matter and how they relate through actual use
- Each agent trajectory leaves a trace; accumulating thousands of these traces causes the **organizational schema to reveal itself from actual usage patterns** rather than from predetermined assumptions
- Practical implication: in many organizations, exceptions that happen consistently are not really exceptions — they are de facto policy. Agents observing real decision patterns will surface this, rather than being constrained by formally stated but practically unused rules
- These emergent structures are described as **world models**, not just retrieval systems

### 9. Humans in the Context Graph Era
- **Aaron Levy (Box)**, in *The Era of Context*, argues that if all companies have access to the same agentic AI, competitive differentiation will come from **context quality and context engineering**
- Key insight: "We imagined that AI systems would adapt to how we work, but it turns out… we will instead adapt to how they work"
- The individual contributor role shifts toward **directing, guiding, and providing oversight** for agents — essentially becoming an agent manager
- Responsibilities include: providing context, setting escalation paths, coordinating between agents, and shepherding work across the system
- Decision traces — the moments where judgment breaks or refines existing patterns — are described as **the most uniquely human contribution** to organizational work

## Key Concepts

- **Context Graph**: A persistent, queryable record of organizational decision traces — who decided what, why, under what conditions, and with what exceptions — stitched across entities and time to form searchable precedent.
- **Decision Trace**: A record of a specific decision event capturing the inputs considered, policies evaluated, exceptions invoked, approvals granted, and outcomes written — the "why" behind a state change.
- **System of Record**: The canonical source for a given piece of enterprise data (e.g., Salesforce for customer records, NetSuite for financials); authoritative on *what* happened but not *why*.
- **What vs. Why Gap**: The distinction between data systems that capture state (what happened) and the absent infrastructure that would capture decision lineage (why it happened that way).
- **Context Engineering**: The practice of designing systems, workflows, and organizational processes to ensure AI agents receive the right context to make good decisions; identified as a key enterprise AI priority for 2026.
- **Tribal Knowledge**: Organizational know-how — such as informal exception policies or precedent-setting decisions — that exists in human memory and informal communication rather than structured data systems.
- **Organizational Ontology**: The set of entities, relationships, and decision patterns that actually govern how an organization operates, which may differ significantly from formally documented processes.
- **Semantic Layer / Data Contract**: A governance mechanism that defines which system is canonical for which metric and the rules for reconciling conflicts between systems.
- **Agentic AI / AI Agents**: AI systems capable of autonomous, multi-step action across tools, systems, and workflows, rather than merely answering queries.
- **World Model**: A richer internal representation that captures not just facts but causal and relational structure — contrasted here with simple retrieval systems.

## Summary

The central argument of this episode is that the next major bottleneck for enterprise AI is not model quality or even data access, but the absence of captured decision rationale. Drawing on essays from Jameen Ball (Foundation Capital), Jay Gupta and Ashut Garg (Foundation Capital), and Aaron Levy (Box), the host builds a layered case: existing systems of record are good at recording *what* happened but structurally incapable of recording *why* — the exceptions, approvals, precedents, and cross-system judgments that actually govern how organizations operate, which currently live in Slack threads, verbal exchanges, and human memory. The concept of a **context graph** — a persistently captured, queryable graph of decision traces generated as agents operate — is proposed as the infrastructure layer that closes this gap. Crucially, the host and the Cogent Enterprise framing argue that these graphs should not be designed top-down with pre-defined schemas, but should emerge organically from agent activity, revealing the organization's actual operating logic rather than its formally stated policies. As this infrastructure matures, the competitive advantage of enterprises will increasingly derive from context quality, and human roles will evolve toward providing the judgment, oversight, and escalation that agents cannot yet supply on their own.
