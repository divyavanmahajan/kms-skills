# How to Use Opus 4.7 and the New Codex
## Study Document

---

## Overview

This episode of the *AI Daily Brief* (a daily podcast and video covering AI news) covers two major releases announced on April 16–17, 2026: **Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.7** model and **OpenAI's updated Codex application**. The host examines what is new in each release, synthesises early user reactions, and offers concrete recommendations for how knowledge workers, entrepreneurs, and engaged AI users should integrate these tools into their workflows. The central argument is that both releases meaningfully expand what can be delegated to AI agents—particularly around long-running, multi-source, agentic tasks—and that the dominant mental model of "one task = one new chat" is now obsolete.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with large language model (LLM) chat interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude)
- General understanding of AI coding assistants and agentic AI concepts
- Familiarity with productivity tools referenced: Slack, Gmail, GitHub, Notion, Obsidian, Google Calendar
- Awareness of Claude's model naming conventions (Claude 3.x, Claude 4.x series) and OpenAI's Codex product
- Optional: Prior exposure to the host's earlier experiments with OpenClaw (an open-source multi-agent framework) and his "personal context portfolio"

## Main Points

### 1. What Is New in the Codex App

- **Computer use on Mac:** Codex can now see, click, and type across any Mac application using its own cursor; multiple agents can run in parallel in the background without disrupting the user's active work; this enables interaction with apps that have no API.
- **In-app browser with comment mode:** Users can load a webpage inside Codex and click directly on UI elements to give the agent precise, visual context—useful for front-end iteration and bug reporting.
- **Native image generation (GPT Image 1.5):** Image creation, editing, and variant generation are now built directly into Codex threads, alongside rich file previews (PDFs, spreadsheets, slides, documents) rendered inline as downloadable artifacts.
- **Quality-of-life improvements:** macOS menu bar and Windows system tray integration, a global hotkey for a mini-Codex window, tabbed terminals within threads, `/compact` as a standalone command, and a theme picker.
- **Chats without a project:** Users can start a thread without first selecting a repository, making Codex function more like a general-purpose notes and task app.

### 2. The Monothread Pattern and Heartbeats

- **Heartbeats** are interval-based automations that resume an *existing* thread rather than spawning a new one, preserving accumulated context, corrections, and history.
- The **monothread** approach (championed by Codex team member Nick Bauman) shifts usage from many short-lived chats to a small number of long-lived threads organised around recurring work streams.
- This shift is enabled by **context compaction improvements**: engineer Anthony Kroger reports that Codex can compact context multiple times with negligible degradation, breaking the prior assumption that long threads inevitably lose coherence.
- A thread's value now *increases over time* as it accumulates examples of what the user acts on, edits, or ignores—gradually producing shorter, more targeted interruptions rather than larger summaries.

**Conceptual architecture of a monothread:**
```
Main Teammate Thread
│  - Orchestration and priority judgment
│  - Checks Slack, Gmail, GitHub, Calendar on schedule
│  - Wakes up → reads signals → notifies only when needed
│
├── Sub-agent Thread A (e.g., code review)
├── Sub-agent Thread B (e.g., customer health)
└── Spawns new sub-agents for new work streams as needed
```

### 3. The Codex Chief of Staff Pattern

- Proposed by Jason Liu (OpenAI), this pattern uses Codex's local folder vault as a **durable memory layer**.
- The vault contains:
  - An `agents.md` file with instructions on how the vault works (prefer updating existing notes over creating new ones; keep facts separate from guesses, etc.)
  - A `projects/` folder (one note per active project or work stream)
  - A `notes/` folder (scratch notes, drafts, one-off captures)
- **Setup interview:** Codex interviews the user about responsibilities, key contacts, what must not be missed, and which sources (Slack channels, email threads, repos, meetings) are relevant.
- **Core loop — every-15-minute heartbeat:**
  1. Check designated sources (Slack, Gmail, Drive, Calendar, GitHub)
  2. Identify pending asks, blockers, or decisions
  3. Track how priorities appear to be shifting
  4. Continue interviewing the user over time to refine the heartbeat prompt, `agents.md`, and project notes

### 4. Recommended Codex Use Cases Beyond Coding

- **Recurring reporting and monitoring:** Morning briefs aggregating Slack DMs, unread emails, Notion updates, and calendar; weekly customer health checks via tools like Intercom.
- **Legacy system data entry:** Computer use can drive old vendor portals, ERP systems, or decade-old accounting software that lack APIs.
- **Cross-system data migration:** Moving data between systems that do not natively integrate (e.g., Granola meeting notes → Obsidian vault).
- **General knowledge work:** Drafting reports, setting up data rooms, reviewing contracts, onboarding clients, generating marketing assets, processing invoices (per Aaron Levy, CEO of Box).

### 5. What Is New in Claude Opus 4.7

- **Not Mythos Preview:** Anthropic acknowledged implied disappointment that this release was not their flagship rumoured model; Opus 4.7 is positioned as a meaningful step forward within the current line.
- **Benchmark improvements (selected):**
  - Agentic coding: 4.7 Low > 4.6 Medium; 4.7 High > 4.6 Max
  - Finance Agent: 60.1% → 64.4%
  - Office QA Pro: 57.1% → 80.6%
  - OS World computer use: 72.7% → 78%
  - Vending Bench 2: ~20% more revenue generated
- **Notable regression:** One long-context retrieval benchmark dropped from 78.3% to 32.2%; the Claude Code team disputes the validity of this benchmark, arguing it overweights distractor/stacking tricks.
- **Design and vision improvements:** Early users report significantly better PowerPoint generation, agentic CAD design, and a notable leap in design sensibility versus 4.6; stronger visual reasoning over whiteboard photos, dashboard screenshots, and chart images in PDFs.

### 6. How to Interact Differently with Opus 4.7

Based on tips from Kat Wu (Claude Code team lead) and Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator):

- **Delegate, don't micromanage:** Treat the model like a capable engineer handed a complete task, not a pair programmer guided step by step. Progressive multi-turn clarification *reduces* quality on 4.7.
- **Front-load all context:** State the full goal, constraints, and acceptance criteria in the first message; each additional user turn adds reasoning overhead.
- **Build explicit verification loops:** 4.7 is better at self-verification than prior models, but the user must specify *how* to verify and instruct the model to do so.
- **Configure effort level:** Boris Cherny uses "extra high" effort for most tasks and "max" effort for the hardest. Max effort applies only to the current session; other levels persist across sessions.
- **Slow it down for design tasks:** The host found that 4.7 produces more varied and better-considered designs when explicitly prompted to reason before executing, rather than allowing it to generate immediately.

### 7. Recommended Opus 4.7 Use Cases

- **End-to-end research projects:** Provide multiple URLs and internal notes; request a substantial output document rather than an article summary.
- **Extended reasoning tasks:** Legal argument construction, investment thesis development, strategic option analysis—tasks previously broken into pieces due to context loss can now potentially be completed in a single pass.
- **Full deliverable production:** Complex data cleaning, cross-functional synthesis, multi-step analysis with verification.
- **Vision-heavy tasks:** Analysing competitor onboarding flows from screenshots, extracting charts from 10-Ks or research PDFs, translating whiteboard photos from meetings.

### 8. Codex vs. Claude Desktop: Divergent UI Philosophies

| Dimension | OpenAI Codex | Anthropic Claude Desktop |
|---|---|---|
| Interface model | Single unified thread for all task types | Separate modes: Claude Chat, Claude Cowork, Claude Code |
| Core bet | Agent intelligence makes mode-switching unnecessary; friction should be eliminated | Different modes of work are different enough that collapsing them creates compromise |
| Analogy | Original ChatGPT: one text box, infinite capabilities | Native apps: specialised tools for specialised tasks |

- The host frames these as genuinely different bets, not a clear winner/loser, and notes users currently have a choice between both approaches.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Opus 4.7:** Anthropic's latest Claude model in the 4.x series, positioned between Claude 4.6 and the unreleased "Mythos" flagship, with meaningful benchmark improvements particularly in agentic coding, office tasks, computer use, and visual reasoning.
- **Codex (OpenAI app):** OpenAI's desktop AI application, originally focused on coding but evolving into a general knowledge-work agent platform with computer use, browser interaction, image generation, and scheduling capabilities.
- **Computer use:** The ability of an AI agent to observe a computer screen and control the mouse and keyboard to interact with any GUI application, including those without APIs.
- **Heartbeat:** A Codex feature that sets an interval-based trigger to wake up and continue work *within an existing thread*, preserving accumulated context rather than starting a new conversation.
- **Monothread:** A usage pattern in which a small number of long-lived agent threads are maintained around recurring work streams rather than starting a new chat for every task.
- **Context compaction:** A technique by which an AI agent summarises and compresses prior conversation history to stay within context limits while retaining essential information; Codex's improved compaction is what makes monothreads viable.
- **Vault (local folder):** A local directory that Codex can read from and write to, functioning as a durable, file-based memory layer across sessions.
- **agents.md:** A configuration file inside the Codex vault that provides the agent with persistent instructions about how to organise notes, distinguish facts from guesses, and interact with the user's work streams.
- **Chief of Staff pattern:** A Codex configuration (proposed by Jason Liu) in which a single long-lived thread with scheduled heartbeats monitors all of a user's information sources, manages project notes, and proactively surfaces only the signals that require attention.
- **Effort level (Claude Code):** A configurable parameter (low / medium / high / extra high / max) that controls how much reasoning compute Claude Code applies to a task; max is session-scoped, others persist across sessions.
- **OpenClaw:** An open-source multi-agent framework the host previously experimented with to build a project-manager / chief-of-staff agent; used as a comparison point for the simpler Codex monothread architecture.
- **Vibe coding:** A term (critiqued in the talk) originally meaning informal, intuition-driven coding with AI assistance; the host argues the more significant trend is that *all knowledge work* is becoming more like coding work.

## Summary

The host argues that the combined release of Claude Opus 4.7 and the newly updated Codex application represents a meaningful—if not revolutionary—expansion of what AI can do for knowledge workers. The most significant conceptual shift is the move away from the "one task, one new chat" mental model toward persistent, long-lived agent threads (monothreads) that accumulate context over time and wake up on schedules to monitor information sources and surface only what matters. This is made technically viable by Codex's improved context compaction and is productised through the new Heartbeats feature. On the model side, Opus 4.7 delivers genuine benchmark improvements across agentic coding, office tasks, and computer use, and requires a different interaction style—front-loaded goals, explicit verification instructions, and delegation rather than step-by-step guidance. The host's overarching message is that users who continue treating these tools as question-answering chatbots will miss the most significant capability unlocks; the real gains now come from designing persistent, autonomous workflows and handing the model genuinely hard, end-to-end tasks.
