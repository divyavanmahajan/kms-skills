# The OpenClaw-ification of AI

## Overview

This episode of the **AI Daily Brief** (recorded February 26, 2026) argues that a wave of product announcements across the AI industry — from Anthropic, Perplexity, Notion, and others — reflects not mere competitive mimicry of OpenClaw, but a broad industry recognition that OpenClaw identified and popularized the fundamental primitives of the emerging agentic AI era. The speaker is the host of the AI Daily Brief podcast/video channel. The episode also covers three headline stories: the Anthropic-Pentagon contract dispute, the stalling of OpenAI's Project Stargate, and NVIDIA's record earnings.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with **Claude** (Anthropic's AI model) and **Claude Code** (Anthropic's coding agent)
- Basic understanding of **agentic AI** — AI systems that take actions autonomously over time, not just respond to single prompts
- Awareness of **OpenClaw** — an open-source framework allowing users to run persistent, scheduled AI agents on a local machine, accessible remotely via messaging apps like Telegram
- General knowledge of **cron jobs** and scheduled task systems in software development
- Basic familiarity with the AI competitive landscape: OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, NVIDIA, xAI
- Understanding of **the Defense Production Act** (U.S. law allowing government to compel production of goods/services deemed critical to national security)

---

## Main Points

### Headline 1: Anthropic vs. the Pentagon

- Anthropic's contract with the Department of Defense was placed in jeopardy over Anthropic's refusal to permit their models to be used for autonomous weaponry or domestic surveillance of Americans.
- The conflict escalated after reports that Anthropic's Claude models were used during a raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro — reportedly without Anthropic's consent — in what became a lethal operation.
- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei a Friday deadline: agree to an "all lawful use" standard (i.e., U.S. law as the only limiting factor, not company policy) or be designated a **supply chain risk** — a designation previously reserved for foreign companies like Huawei.
- Hegseth also threatened to invoke the **Defense Production Act** to compel Anthropic to supply a version of Claude without built-in guardrails, though legal commentators noted this use would be unusual and potentially contradictory.
- As of the episode's recording, Anthropic had not agreed to Pentagon demands. Axios reported the Pentagon was already taking preparatory steps, contacting Boeing and Lockheed Martin to assess dependencies on Anthropic technology.
- The broader significance: this dispute represents a live, practical confrontation over who — AI labs or the U.S. government — has final authority over how military AI is deployed. Critics noted Congress, not bilateral CEO-to-Secretary haggling, should be setting these rules.

### Headline 2: Project Stargate Is Stalling

- Project Stargate, announced in January 2025 as a $500 billion data center investment involving OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, has largely failed to materialize as structured.
- Sources told *The Information* that the joint venture fell apart within weeks of announcement due to lack of leadership and coordination — the three parties could not agree on roles and responsibilities.
- OpenAI sought independent financing but lenders were unwilling to issue multi-billion dollar loans against an unproven company.
- OpenAI subsequently pursued bilateral partnerships with Oracle and SoftBank separately, but no project involves all three original Stargate participants simultaneously.
- The original target was 10 gigawatts of committed compute by end of 2025; the actual figures are approximately 6 GW contracted with Oracle and 2 GW with SoftBank, with only one facility partially operational.
- OpenAI's compute scaling team framed Stargate as the "umbrella brand" for a broader strategy, arguing the underlying vision is being realized — but at smaller scale and slower pace than announced.

### Headline 3: NVIDIA Crushes Earnings

- NVIDIA reported $68.1 billion in quarterly revenue, up 73% year-over-year, beating expectations by approximately 11 percentage points.
- Data center revenue grew even faster at 75% year-over-year; guidance for the next quarter projects 77% annualized growth.
- NVIDIA continues to model zero revenue from China in forecasts, representing potential upside if export restrictions ease.
- CEO Jensen Huang stated that demand for AI compute ("tokens") has gone "completely exponential," with even six-year-old GPUs in the cloud fully consumed at rising prices.
- NVIDIA disclosed $3.5 billion in guarantees provided to neocloud companies developing data centers — four times the amount from the prior quarter — allowing smaller firms to access debt on favorable terms. This creates contingent liability risk if AI demand falters.
- Despite the strong results, the market response was muted: NVIDIA stock initially gained 3% in after-hours trading but fell below its closing price later in the evening, reflecting broader market uncertainty around AI.

### Main Episode: The OpenClaw-ification of AI

#### What Is OpenClaw and Why Does It Matter?

- **OpenClaw** is an open-source project that allows users to run persistent, always-on AI agents on a local machine (e.g., a Mac Mini), accessible remotely via messaging apps like Telegram or WhatsApp.
- Its key capabilities include: remote access from any device, scheduled/recurring tasks (cron jobs), a "heartbeat" mechanism that keeps agents active on a regular timer, and deep integration with local context (files, repos, tools).
- The speaker describes personally using OpenClaw for 24/7 research agents that continuously update information for the show and related projects.

#### Claude Code Remote Control

- Anthropic announced a **remote control feature for Claude Code**, allowing users to initiate a coding session on their local terminal and monitor or direct it from a phone via the Claude app or cloud.ai/code.
- Immediate reactions on social media drew direct comparisons to OpenClaw's remote access via Telegram/WhatsApp.
- The feature was so popular it caused capacity issues; Claude Code PM Noah Zwieben publicly apologized and promised a broader rollout.
- A nuanced comparison: Claude Code Remote Control is a **session-based, dev-environment-aware tool** (knows your repo, local CLI, node modules), while OpenClaw is an **always-on, 24/7 butler** better suited for continuous background tasks.
- The speaker partially disagrees with characterizations that limit OpenClaw to personal/lifestyle tasks, noting his most valuable OpenClaw agents are research-focused.

#### Cowork Scheduled Tasks

- One day after the remote control announcement, Anthropic announced **Scheduled Tasks** for Cowork — allowing Claude to run recurring tasks automatically at specified times (e.g., morning briefs, weekly spreadsheet updates, automated reminders).
- This mirrors OpenClaw's cron job and heartbeat functionality directly.
- Commentary framed it as a categorical shift: *"Chat was a toy. Scheduled tasks is a labor primitive."*
- Current limitation: scheduled tasks only run when the computer is awake and the Cowork desktop app is open; the task is skipped and run retroactively on next wake.
- Observers noted the white-collar labor implications: tasks formerly requiring SaaS products, Zapier workflows, or junior employees can now run on a $20/month subscription. The speaker notes this framing — pure job elimination — is likely reductionist.

#### Perplexity Computer

- Perplexity announced **Perplexity Computer**, described as a system that unifies research, design, coding, deployment, and project management end-to-end.
- It features persistent memory, hundreds of connectors, parallel agent orchestration, and access to 19 models (vs. OpenClaw's reliance on Anthropic models only).
- CEO Arvind Srinivas argued in a blog post titled "The AI Is the Computer" that the chat UI and single-task agents are both bottlenecks; the correct interface for full AI capability is the computer itself, now reframed as a massively multimodal orchestration layer.
- Observers directly labeled it "Perplexity's OpenClaw."

#### Notion Custom Agents and Other Products

- **Notion** announced **Custom Agents** — described as "the AI team that never sleeps," supporting autonomous, scheduled, trigger-based tasks across teams without requiring technical knowledge (no cron job or CLI literacy needed).
- **Airtable** launched **SuperAgent**, characterized as adjacent to the same paradigm (closer to Manus/Genspark but in similar territory).
- These products lower the barrier to entry for the agentic primitives OpenClaw introduced, making them accessible to non-technical users.

#### The Central Argument: Primitives, Not Features

- The speaker argues these announcements should **not** be read as companies trying to catch up with or copy OpenClaw competitively.
- Instead, they reflect industry-wide recognition that OpenClaw was the first to **popularize the fundamental primitives of the agentic era**:
  1. **Persistent work** — AI that operates without continuous user prompting
  2. **Mobility** — interactive modalities that follow the user across devices
  3. **Scheduled autonomy** — tasks that execute on a defined schedule without user initiation
  4. **Personal context integration** — agents with access to the user's own systems, data, and tools
- These primitives will become ubiquitous because they unlock capabilities people demonstrably want.
- The speaker's recommendation: even as these features become productized and abstracted, **doing the hard work of setting up OpenClaw manually** provides a deeper education in understanding the underlying primitives than polished products can offer.

## Key Concepts

- **OpenClaw**: An open-source framework for running persistent, remotely accessible AI agents on a local machine, popularized as an early implementation of always-on agentic AI.
- **Agentic AI**: AI systems capable of taking sequences of actions autonomously over time, interacting with external tools and systems, without requiring a human prompt for each step.
- **Heartbeat (OpenClaw)**: A periodic self-reminder mechanism (default: every 30 minutes) that causes an OpenClaw agent to reassert its mission and resume work if it has lapsed.
- **Cron job**: A time-based job scheduler used in software to run tasks automatically at specified intervals or times; a key mechanism underlying OpenClaw's scheduled task functionality.
- **Remote Control (Claude Code)**: Anthropic's feature enabling users to initiate a Claude Code session on a local terminal and interact with it from a mobile device via the Claude app.
- **Scheduled Tasks (Cowork)**: Anthropic's Cowork feature allowing Claude to automatically execute recurring tasks at specified times without user prompting.
- **Perplexity Computer**: Perplexity's unified AI system combining research, coding, design, deployment, and project management with multi-model orchestration and persistent memory.
- **Notion Custom Agents**: Notion's autonomous, team-oriented agents that execute on triggers or schedules without requiring user prompting or technical expertise.
- **All Lawful Use standard**: The Pentagon's demanded contract term specifying that U.S. law — not AI company policy — is the sole constraint on how AI models may be used in military operations.
- **Defense Production Act**: U.S. legislation allowing the federal government to compel companies to supply goods or services deemed critical to national security, invoked here as a threat against Anthropic.
- **Supply Chain Risk designation**: A U.S. government classification that bars a company's products from use by military contractors; previously applied only to foreign entities like Huawei.
- **Project Stargate**: A joint venture announced in January 2025 among OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle targeting $500 billion in AI data center investment; reported to have stalled due to coordination failures.
- **OpenClaw-ification**: The speaker's coined term for the phenomenon of mainstream AI products adopting the primitives (persistent operation, remote access, scheduled autonomy, personal context integration) that OpenClaw first popularized.

## Summary

The central argument of this episode is that a cluster of product announcements in late February 2026 — Claude Code Remote Control, Cowork Scheduled Tasks, Perplexity Computer, Notion Custom Agents, and others — collectively represent what the speaker calls the "OpenClaw-ification of AI": not competitive copying, but an industry-wide convergence on the fundamental primitives of agentic AI that OpenClaw was the first to popularize. These primitives — persistent autonomous operation, device-agnostic remote accessibility, scheduled task execution, and deep personal context integration — are, in the speaker's view, not features to be owned by any one product but rather the defining characteristics of how AI will function in the emerging agentic era. The episode situates these developments against a backdrop of significant industry tension: Anthropic's confrontation with the Pentagon over autonomous weapons use, OpenAI's Stargate infrastructure ambitions falling short of their announced scale, and NVIDIA's continued dominance of AI compute despite markets struggling to price the uncertainty. The speaker's closing recommendation is that even as these primitives become abstracted into polished consumer products, practitioners who invest in understanding them at the foundational level — by working through tools like OpenClaw directly — will be better positioned to navigate the paradigm shift ahead.
