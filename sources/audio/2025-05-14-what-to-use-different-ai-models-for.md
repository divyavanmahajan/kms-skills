# When to Use Different AI Models: A Practical Guide to OpenAI's Model Suite

## Overview

This episode of the *AI Daily Brief* addresses a common source of confusion for both individual and enterprise users of ChatGPT: which OpenAI model to select, and for what purpose. The host walks through OpenAI's own guidance (published in their enterprise help center under "When to Use Each Model"), supplements it with practical use cases organized by user type, and distills the information into an actionable cheat sheet. The talk is relevant given that ChatGPT recently surpassed 800 million weekly active users and daily professional usage has jumped from 22% to 58% (KPMG Pulse survey).

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with large language models (LLMs) and conversational AI tools such as ChatGPT
- General awareness of AI terminology: reasoning models, multimodal inputs, context windows, tokens
- Some exposure to professional or enterprise software workflows (e.g., knowledge work, marketing, data operations, HR)
- No programming or data science background is required; technical model comparisons are kept accessible

---

## Main Points

### 1. The Model Selection Problem Is Real and Widespread

- ChatGPT's model selector presents users with six or more options (GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, O3, O4 Mini, O4 Mini High, O1 Pro) with minimal guidance
- OpenAI's in-app descriptions (e.g., "great for most tasks") are insufficient to drive informed choices
- The confusion is not trivial: as AI becomes endemic in professional workflows, poor model selection means wasted time and suboptimal outputs
- OpenAI published an enterprise-facing help center post titled "When to Use Each Model," which forms the primary basis of this episode

---

### 2. GPT-4o — The Daily Workhorse

- Designed for **everyday, generalist tasks**: summarizing meeting notes, drafting follow-up emails, proofreading reports
- Fully **multimodal**: accepts documents, images, CSVs, audio, video; supports image generation, advanced voice, data analysis, and Canvas
- Best used when the task is routine, low-stakes, and primarily about capturing key ideas rather than producing polished prose
- Representative use cases by user type:
  - *Solopreneur:* Feeding podcast transcripts to generate show note summaries
  - *SME/Mid-market/Enterprise:* Ingesting call recordings and slides to produce prospect follow-up decks; creating standard operating procedure (SOP) documents
- **Key descriptors:** generalist, multimodal, high-volume workhorse

---

### 3. GPT-4.5 — The Creative Writing Specialist

- Does **not** mean "strictly better than 4o" — it means better at a specific category of tasks
- Optimized for **creative writing, emotional intelligence, empathy, and external-facing communication**
- OpenAI example prompts: LinkedIn posts, product descriptions, empathetic customer apology letters
- The host recommends defaulting to 4.5 any time the **quality and tone of the written output matters** — thought leadership, HR communications, social media copy, long-form articles
- Tasks where 4o suffices: rote summarization where capturing ideas matters more than the quality of prose
- Representative use cases by user type:
  - *Solopreneur:* Thought leadership writing, generating headline or title variations for articles
  - *SME:* Empathetic HR templates (performance reviews, onboarding notes)
  - *Enterprise:* Drafting localization-ready customer service macros aligned to brand voice guidelines
- **Key descriptors:** creative, empathetic, outward-facing writing

---

### 4. O4 Mini and O4 Mini High — Technical Specialists

- Despite the name, O4 Mini is **not a general upgrade over O3**; it is purpose-built for fast, technical tasks
- **O4 Mini:** Fast STEM queries, programming, visual reasoning, data extraction from CSVs, quick Python debugging
- **O4 Mini High:** Same domain as O4 Mini but optimized for **depth and accuracy** over speed — complex math, advanced SQL, detailed scientific explanations
- Usage limits reflect intended scale: O4 Mini gets 300 requests/day (enterprise); O4 Mini High gets 100/day
- Representative use cases:
  - *Solopreneur:* Fixing WordPress CSS bugs
  - *SME:* IT help desk assistant
  - *Mid-market:* Data ops teams generating ad hoc Python ETL scripts
  - *Enterprise:* Continuous code review bots flagging security issues across pull requests
- **Key descriptors:** technical, STEM-focused; largely irrelevant to non-technical roles

---

### 5. O1 Pro Mode — The Legacy High-Stakes Reasoning Specialist

- Available in the enterprise plan; not in the default model selector for individuals (listed under "more models" as a legacy reasoning expert)
- Designed for **accuracy-critical, long-form, high-stakes outputs** where exhaustive internal reasoning is required
- Sacrifices speed for a more thorough reasoning pass; optimized for lengthy single-generation outputs (tens of thousands of words)
- Both O1 Pro and O3 share a 200k token context window, but O1 Pro is tuned to output far more tokens in one pass
- Enterprise allocation: only **5 queries per user per month**
- Use cases: regulatory filings, safety-critical engineering reviews, litigation briefs, ISO 27001 compliance handbooks, patent landscape reviews, multi-jurisdictional impact assessments
- **Versus O3:** Use O1 Pro when output length is extreme or accuracy is safety-critical; use O3 for most complex reasoning tasks
- **Key descriptors:** slow, accuracy-first, legacy, low-volume, long-form

---

### 6. O3 — The Advanced Reasoning Workhorse

- OpenAI's current **state-of-the-art full-version reasoning model**
- Suited for **complex, multi-step tasks**: strategic planning, detailed analysis, advanced math, extensive coding, competitive intelligence
- OpenAI example prompts: market expansion risk analysis, multi-step CSV analysis, pipeline metric review, business strategy outlines
- Usage limits: 100 requests per week (enterprise)
- The **Deep Research tool runs on O3** — it uses O3's reasoning and planning to devise a research strategy, source materials, and synthesize outputs
- The host identifies O3 as the model that first made AI viable as a genuine **strategic thought partner**, not just a task-completion tool
- O3 produces more **structured, visually organized outputs** (charts, hierarchies) compared to 4o and 4.5
- Representative use cases:
  - *Solopreneur:* Building investor-ready financial models
  - *SME:* Supply chain simulations factoring in tariffs and currency risk
  - *Enterprise:* Deep research dossiers, strategic planning documents
- **Key descriptors:** reasoning, strategic, structured output, thought partner

### 7. Practical Cheat Sheet — Three Models That Matter Most

| Model | Best For | Signal Phrase |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| GPT-4o | Routine, high-volume, multimodal tasks | "Low stakes, just want it done" |
| GPT-4.5 | External-facing writing where quality and tone matter | "The words need to be good" |
| O3 | Strategic thinking, planning, complex analysis | "I need a real thought partner" |

- When a document needs both structured reasoning (O3) and polished prose (4.5): use O3 for the overall structure, then rewrite key sections (e.g., the introduction) with 4.5
- O4 Mini / O4 Mini High: relevant primarily to technical roles
- O1 Pro: relevant only for rare, extremely long or accuracy-critical documents

---

## Key Concepts

- **GPT-4o:** OpenAI's general-purpose multimodal model; handles text, image, audio, and video inputs; designed for everyday high-volume tasks
- **GPT-4.5:** A model optimized for creative writing, emotional intelligence, and outward-facing communication; not a universal upgrade over 4o
- **O4 Mini / O4 Mini High:** Reasoning models scoped specifically to technical tasks (coding, math, STEM); Mini prioritizes speed, Mini High prioritizes depth
- **O1 Pro Mode:** A legacy reasoning model optimized for extreme accuracy and very long single-pass outputs; limited to five enterprise queries per user per month
- **O3:** OpenAI's current flagship full reasoning model; best suited for strategic, multi-step, analytical tasks; powers the Deep Research tool
- **Deep Research:** An OpenAI tool built on O3 that autonomously plans a research strategy, retrieves sources, and synthesizes findings into a structured output
- **Reasoning model:** A class of LLM that performs additional internal computation ("thinking") before producing a response, trading speed for improved accuracy on complex tasks
- **Multimodal:** The capability of a model to accept and process multiple input types — text, image, audio, video, structured data files
- **Context window:** The maximum number of tokens (roughly, words and word-fragments) a model can process in a single interaction; O1 Pro and O3 both support 200k tokens
- **Token output limit:** A constraint on how many tokens a model generates in a single response; O1 Pro is designed to generate substantially more tokens per pass than other models

## Summary

The host's central argument is that OpenAI's model lineup, while confusing in name, maps cleanly onto distinct use case categories once the underlying design logic is understood. For most knowledge workers, three models cover the vast majority of needs: GPT-4o for routine, multimodal, high-volume tasks where speed and breadth matter; GPT-4.5 for any writing where the quality, tone, or emotional resonance of the output is important; and O3 for complex strategic thinking, planning, and analysis — the first model the host considers capable of functioning as a genuine thought partner rather than a sophisticated autocomplete tool. Technical specialists may additionally draw on O4 Mini or O4 Mini High, and rare high-stakes documents may warrant O1 Pro, but these are edge cases for most users. The broader implication is that intentional model selection — rather than defaulting to a single option — is an increasingly important professional skill as AI becomes embedded in daily work.
