# How People Actually Use AI Agents: Study Notes
*Based on AI Daily Brief episode, February 19, 2026*

## Overview

This episode of the **AI Daily Brief** covers Anthropic's study titled *"Measuring AI Agent Autonomy in Practice,"* which examines how AI agents are actually used in real-world settings — as opposed to idealized benchmarks. The host argues that the study is less about raw autonomy metrics and more about the evolving human-agent interaction dynamic, the broadening user base, and the expansion of agentic use cases beyond software engineering. The episode also covers headlines on Google's Lyria 3 music generator, Anthropic's OAuth terms-of-service controversy, Meta's revived smartwatch project, Grok Heavy's 16-agent mode, and skepticism about Chinese model benchmarks.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with AI agents and how they differ from standard LLM chat interfaces
- Understanding of what tools/tool calls mean in the context of AI agent frameworks (e.g., function calling, shell execution)
- Familiarity with the concept of benchmarking AI models and their limitations
- General awareness of products such as Claude Code, OpenClaw, and the Meter evaluation framework
- Basic understanding of OAuth tokens and API access models

---

## Main Points

### 1. The Meter Benchmark: What It Measures and What It Misses

- Meter measures the **duration of tasks (as a human would define them)** that an AI agent can complete at a given success rate — not the literal wall-clock time the AI takes.
- Two success thresholds are used: **50% and 80%**, neither of which would be acceptable in a real production context.
- The benchmark's value lies in its **consistency over time and across models**, making it useful for tracking relative progress.
- Its key limitation, per Anthropic: it "captures what a model is capable of in an **idealized setting** with no human interaction and no real-world consequences."

### 2. Why Claude Code Was Chosen as the Primary Data Source

- Anthropic argues Claude Code represents the first AI agent with genuine **product-market fit**, functioning as a general-purpose agent enabled through code rather than a narrow coding tool.
- Because Claude Code is Anthropic's own product, they can observe **entire agent workflows end-to-end**, unlike the public API where they can only analyze individual tool calls in isolation.
- Public API data offers **diversity of use cases**; Claude Code data offers **workflow completeness**.

### 3. Methodology: Measuring Autonomy in Practice

- **Definition of an agent used**: An AI system equipped with tools that allow it to take actions; studying tool calls as a proxy for real-world behavior.
- **Turn duration** (time elapsed between Claude starting and stopping work) is used as the primary measure of autonomous operation in Claude Code.
- The **median turn duration is approximately 45 seconds** and has been stable for months — most usage is short and interactive.
- To understand the ceiling of capability, Anthropic focuses on the **99.9th percentile of turn duration**, reasoning these represent the most advanced use cases.

### 4. Observed Trends in Turn Duration Over Time

- Between **October and January** (Sonnet 4.5 through Opus 4.5 releases), the 99.9th percentile turn duration grew from **~25 minutes to ~45 minutes**.
- Notably, this increase was **smooth across model releases**, suggesting autonomy gains are not purely a function of model capability jumps but also of context, tooling, and user behavior.
- Over the **last six weeks of the study period**, duration dipped from ~45 minutes back toward ~40 minutes. Two candidate explanations:
  - A post-holiday shift toward **more tightly scoped work tasks** (versus exploratory personal projects).
  - The Claude Code user base **doubled in the January–mid-February period**, introducing a more diverse and less advanced user cohort that reshaped the distribution.

### 5. Human Supervision Patterns: New Users vs. Power Users

- Claude Code's default requires manual approval of each action; users can also enable **full auto-approval**.
- **New users** use full auto-approval ~**20%** of the time; **experienced users** use it ~**40%** of the time — roughly double, interpreted as accumulated trust.
- **Interruption rates** show the inverse pattern: new users interrupt ~**5%** of the time; experienced users ~**9%** of the time.
- Two explanations offered:
  1. New users front-load oversight via action approval, reducing the need to interrupt mid-task.
  2. Experienced users develop **sharper instincts** for when intervention is needed — analogous to a manager learning when to check in on a junior employee.
- As model capability improved from August to December, **average human interventions per session dropped from 5.4 to 3.3**, demonstrating that better models and greater autonomy are correlated with fewer needed interruptions.

### 6. Claude as an Active Participant in the Autonomy Dynamic

- Autonomy is bidirectional: not just how much humans intervene, but also **how often Claude stops to ask for clarification**.
- For **high-complexity goals**: humans interrupted 7.1% of the time; Claude asked for clarification **16.4%** of the time.
- For **minimal-complexity goals**: humans interrupted 5.5%; Claude asked for clarification 6.6%.
- The gap between human interruptions and Claude's self-interruptions **widens with task complexity**.
- **Top reason humans interrupt Claude**: providing missing context or corrections (~32%).
- **Top reason Claude stops itself**: presenting the user with a **choice between approaches** (~35%) — framed not as a failure of autonomy but as a proactive alignment mechanism.

### 7. Domain Distribution of Agentic Tool Calls

- **Software engineering** accounts for approximately **50%** of all tool calls.
- The remaining ~50% spans other domains:

| Domain | Share of Tool Calls |
|---|---|
| Software Engineering | ~50% |
| Back Office Automation | 9.1% |
| Marketing & Copywriting | 4.4% |
| Sales & CRM | 4.3% |
| Finance & Accounting | 4.0% |

- The fact that **more than half of agentic use cases already fall outside software engineering** at this early stage is highlighted as a significant and underappreciated finding.

### 8. Implications: Capability Overhang and the Future of Autonomy

- The average turn being just 45 seconds, despite the model being capable of 40–45 minute autonomous runs, is cited as evidence of a **capability overhang** — users are not yet extracting the full autonomous capability of the tools.
- Reframing autonomy: it is not just a property of the model but a function of **model capability + human interactive state + permissions + scope**.
- A future design challenge identified by commenters: creating modes that skip pointless confirmation prompts while still respecting "blast radius" boundaries (avoiding irreversible or high-stakes actions without approval).
- The longer-term horizon, as articulated by OpenAI's Sherwin Wu, is **long-duration autonomy** — dispatching agents for 6+ hours of independent work — which current usage patterns do not yet reflect.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent autonomy**: The degree to which an AI agent can complete tasks independently, over extended durations, without human intervention.
- **Meter benchmark**: An evaluation framework measuring the duration of tasks (as defined by human effort) that an AI can complete at a given success rate; used to track progress in agent capability over time.
- **Turn duration**: In Claude Code, the elapsed time between when the model begins working and when it stops; used as a proxy for the length of autonomous operation.
- **99.9th percentile turn duration**: The study's chosen signal for maximum capability, filtering out typical short sessions to focus on the most advanced use cases.
- **Full auto-approval**: A Claude Code setting where users pre-authorize the agent to take actions without requiring per-action confirmation.
- **Tool calls**: Discrete actions an agent takes using equipped tools (e.g., running code, reading files, calling APIs); used as the unit of analysis for the public API data in this study.
- **Capability overhang**: A condition where model capability exceeds how much of that capability users are actually deploying in practice.
- **Blast radius**: Informal term for the potential scope of damage or irreversibility of an agent's actions, used to define appropriate autonomy boundaries.
- **OAuth tokens**: Authentication credentials that allow third-party applications to access services on behalf of a user; in context, used to access Anthropic models via non-API subscriptions.
- **SynthID**: Google DeepMind's audio watermarking system for identifying AI-generated content.
- **Lyria 3**: Google DeepMind's latest text/image/video-to-music generation model, integrated into the Gemini app and YouTube's DreamTrack.

## Summary

Anthropic's study *"Measuring AI Agent Autonomy in Practice"* offers a grounded empirical counterpart to theoretical benchmark studies like Meter by examining how agents — primarily through Claude Code — are actually used. The central finding is that real-world agent autonomy is not determined by model capability alone but is a complex, evolving interaction between model capability, human trust accumulation, task scope, and active co-supervision by both user and model. While the median Claude Code session lasts only 45 seconds, the upper tail of usage has grown substantially over recent months, pointing to a significant capability overhang. More than half of agentic tool calls already occur outside software engineering, signaling that the market for AI agents is diversifying rapidly beyond the engineering-centric early adopters. The study collectively argues that the next frontier is not only building more capable models but designing better paradigms for human-agent collaboration — and eventually, trusted long-duration autonomous operation.
