# What OpenAI and Anthropic Think Happens Next with AI

## Overview

This episode of the **AI Daily Brief** (dated June 5, 2026) examines two major documents released by the leading AI labs — Anthropic's essay *"When AI Builds Itself"* and OpenAI's policy paper *"Democratic Governance of Frontier AI: A Blueprint for a Federal Framework"* — and explores what these documents reveal about how the labs perceive the current trajectory of AI development, including the prospect of recursive self-improvement (RSI). The episode also covers related headlines: U.S. government equity discussions with AI labs, OpenAI's new "Dreaming" memory system, TSMC's chip shortage warnings, and upcoming model releases from both Anthropic and OpenAI. The host is the unnamed presenter of the AI Daily Brief podcast/video channel.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with large language models (LLMs) and frontier AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind)
- Understanding of AI safety concepts, including alignment and existential risk
- Awareness of the competitive AI landscape in 2025–2026
- Familiarity with U.S. tech policy, federal vs. state regulatory dynamics
- Basic understanding of semiconductor supply chains (TSMC, chip fabrication)
- Familiarity with software development workflows (code review, agentic coding tools like Claude Code)

---

## Main Points

### 1. U.S. Government Explores Equity Stakes in AI Labs

- Senior U.S. officials have held preliminary discussions with major AI companies about the federal government acquiring equity shares, per reporting from *Notice* (journalist Jeff Stein).
- Sam Altman reportedly pitched the idea to President Trump in early 2025, framing it as a mechanism to distribute AI's economic benefits broadly — potentially via an "AI dividend" check to American households.
- The arrangement is described as AI labs *voluntarily ceding* shares; it is unclear whether the government would pay for them.
- Anthropic is not currently part of these equity discussions.
- The proposal drew bipartisan commentary — ranging from Bernie Sanders' call for a 50% government stake (via one-time tax) to populist-right figures like Steve Bannon expressing similar sentiments — illustrating an unusual ideological convergence.
- Critics, including Georgetown law professor Peter Harrell, argued taxation and regulation were more appropriate tools than ownership, which risks giving government opaque control.

### 2. OpenAI Ships "Dreaming" Memory System

- OpenAI launched a major upgrade to ChatGPT's memory system, branded **Dreaming**, which replaces individual saved memory entries with a continuously updated user summary.
- The summary is transparent and user-editable.
- **Benchmark performance** on tasks requiring recall of relevant facts:
  - 2024 version (saved list): **41.5%** success rate
  - 2025 early Dreaming: **67.9%** success rate
  - Current Dreaming release: **82.8%** success rate
- Compute efficiency improved by **5x**, enabling Dreaming to be offered to **free users** for the first time.
- The system is conceptually analogous to maintaining a `memory.md` file in agentic workflows, but automated at the backend level, removing friction for average users.
- The efficiency gains are framed in the context of the **token scarcity era** — eliminating wasted tokens spent re-establishing context each session.

---

### 3. TSMC Warns of Prolonged Chip Shortage

- TSMC CEO C.C. Wei stated at the annual shareholders meeting that customer demand is far outpacing supply: *"It will be a long time before we can meet customer demand."*
- TSMC has committed to six new fabs in Arizona, but construction is behind schedule due to environmental permitting delays and a shortage of construction workers.
- Wei said he would like to raise prices but wants to avoid the kind of abrupt price hikes seen in memory chips, referencing competitors with ~80% gross margins.
- The shortage is expected to persist through the end of the decade.

### 4. Upcoming Model Releases: GPT-5.6 and Mythos

- Leaked API endpoints and red-team disclosures suggest Anthropic is close to publicly launching **Mythos** (codename: Oceanus), priced at approximately $16/million input tokens and $80/million output tokens — roughly 3x the cost of Opus 4.8.
- OpenAI has hinted at new releases with a "Time to Fly" promotional video, with speculation about a new ultra-fast speed mode.
- The **timing** of OpenAI's GPT-5.6 release relative to Mythos is analyzed as a signal of competitive confidence:
  - If OpenAI releases *before* Mythos: they believe 5.6 cannot match Mythos, and are pre-empting Anthropic's momentum.
  - If OpenAI releases *after* Mythos: they believe 5.6 can neutralize or surpass Mythos.

### 5. Anthropic's "When AI Builds Itself" — RSI and Three Futures

- The central theme is **recursive self-improvement (RSI)**: AI systems increasingly participating in the development of their own successors.
- Key reported metrics at Anthropic:
  - Engineers ship **8x more code per quarter** than they did in 2021–2025.
  - **80% of Claude's production code** is now authored by Claude itself.
  - Claude Code session success rates across task categories (trivial, routine, substantial, open-ended) have climbed well above **60–80%** over the past year.
  - The rate at which human engineers must correct or take over from Claude mid-task has been **falling steadily**.
- Claude is increasingly proposing its own experiments, narrowing the human role to research taste and judgment: *choosing which problems matter, which results to trust, and when an approach is a dead end.*
- **Amdahl's Law** is invoked: accelerating one part of the pipeline shifts the bottleneck elsewhere (e.g., human code review is now a bottleneck at Anthropic).

#### Three Possible Futures

| Scenario | Description | Likelihood (per Anthropic) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Trend Stalls** | S-curve slowdown; capabilities plateau; today's AI diffuses broadly | Low — no evidence of curve bending yet |
| **2. Compounding Efficiency** | AI development substantially automated; humans retain research direction; 100-person companies do work of 100,000-person orgs | **Most likely** based on current evidence |
| **3. Full RSI** | AI systems autonomously design their own successors; implications highly uncertain | Possible; significant unknowns |

- Anthropic acknowledges they believe a **global slowdown or pause** in frontier AI development would likely be beneficial, but argue a unilateral pause merely shifts the frontrunner without creating deliberation structures.
- They call for conversations involving policymakers, researchers, civil society, and other AI companies in the coming months.

#### Public Reactions to Anthropic's Document

- **AI safety advocates**: Mixed — some thrilled, others (e.g., Nate Soares) argue the tone is too sanguine given the stakes.
- **Critics**: Sean Ralston and Corey Quinn argue the document is insincere — calling for a pause while filing an S-1 and continuing to race ahead is characterized as cynical moat-building.
- **Bill Gurley (All In podcast)**: After 30 days reading Anthropic's writing, concluded: *"I don't think they're writing software. I think they're midwifing a deity."*
- **David Sacks**: Argued that warning of catastrophic risks and then racing ahead is implicitly asking the government to save the public from the labs themselves.

### 6. OpenAI's "Democratic Governance of Frontier AI" Policy Paper

- OpenAI's paper also opens with a reference to RSI as a current observable phenomenon, framing it as a governance challenge existing institutions are not equipped to address.
- Three proposed policy directions:
  1. **Reverse federalism**: Congress should adopt and scale up the best existing state-level AI regulations rather than wholesale preempting them.
  2. **Civilian evaluation institutions**: Invest in civilian bodies like **CAISI** (Center for AI Standards and Innovation) rather than the NSA (as the recent executive order specified); advocates for eventually making AI evaluations **mandatory**, not just voluntary — which runs counter to the current EO.
  3. **Whole-of-government resilience**: Treat frontier AI as a national priority requiring coordination across national security, public health, cybersecurity, scientific, diplomatic, and economic agencies, and international partners.
- AI policy expert Dean Ball noted that keeping evaluation in a civilian, non-classified agency reduces the risk of testing morphing into a de facto licensing/permitting regime.

---

### 7. Congressional AI Legislation

- Republican Jay Obernolte and Democrat Lori Trahan introduced a bipartisan **269-page AI bill** in the House.
- The bill would establish a federal regulatory framework preempting state AI laws and require leading AI labs to develop and implement plans for addressing catastrophic risks, with third-party auditor compliance checks.
- Controversy exists around federal preemption of state authority — states like New York and Massachusetts have already passed their own AI laws.
- Speaker Mike Johnson described AI legislation as a "high priority" but was non-committal on timing before midterms.
- Overall prognosis: *more viable in substance than most AI bills, but timeline before midterms is uncertain.*

---

## Key Concepts

- **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI):** The process by which an AI system contributes to the design and development of its own more capable successors, potentially creating a compounding feedback loop.
- **Dreaming (OpenAI):** OpenAI's updated memory architecture for ChatGPT that maintains a dynamic, holistic user summary rather than a discrete list of saved facts, with 5x improved compute efficiency.
- **Amdahl's Law:** A principle from computing stating that the speedup of a system from optimizing one component is limited by the fraction of time that component is actually used; applied here to organizational bottlenecks in AI-accelerated workflows.
- **Token scarcity era:** A framing of the current AI infrastructure period in which compute and token throughput are constrained resources, making token-efficient architectures (like persistent memory) strategically valuable.
- **Mythos (Anthropic):** An upcoming Anthropic model, reportedly more capable than Opus 4.8, with a red-team checkpoint codenamed Oceanus and premium pricing (~$16/M input, $80/M output tokens).
- **Reverse federalism:** OpenAI's proposed legislative approach in which Congress adopts the best elements of existing state AI regulations rather than creating entirely new federal rules that preempt states.
- **CAISI (Center for AI Standards and Innovation):** A civilian U.S. government body that OpenAI advocates should lead AI safety evaluations, as an alternative to the NSA-centered approach in the recent executive order.
- **Whole-of-government resilience strategy:** OpenAI's proposed policy framework treating frontier AI as a cross-agency national priority, analogous to how cybersecurity or public health are treated.
- **Horseshoe theory:** The political science concept that the far left and far right converge on certain issues; invoked here regarding both Sanders and Bannon supporting government stakes in AI companies.

## Summary

The episode's central argument is that both OpenAI and Anthropic are now publicly signaling — through their own written documents — that AI development is approaching a qualitatively different phase characterized by recursive self-improvement, where AI systems play an increasing role in building their successors. Anthropic's *"When AI Builds Itself"* presents internal data showing dramatic productivity gains and a shrinking human role in the coding and experimentation process, offers three possible futures (stagnation, compounding efficiency, or full RSI), and calls for global coordination mechanisms while acknowledging no such mechanisms yet exist. OpenAI's policy paper echoes the RSI framing and proposes concrete legislative directions: reverse federalism, civilian-led mandatory evaluations, and whole-of-government coordination. The host argues that reading these documents together — alongside the competitive dynamics of upcoming model releases — reveals that both labs believe they are at or near an inflection point, and that the institutions of government, civil society, and industry are not yet prepared to manage what comes next. The broader public and political discourse, from potential government equity stakes to congressional legislation, reflects both the urgency and the deep uncertainty that now surrounds frontier AI.
