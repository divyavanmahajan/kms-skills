# Context Engineering: What It Is and Why It Matters

## Overview

This episode of the *AI Daily Brief* (published June 26, 2025) explores the emerging concept of **context engineering** — what it means, how it differs from prompt engineering, and why it is becoming central to both AI agent development and everyday LLM usage. The host (Nathaniel Whittemore, based on the show's known presenter) argues that context engineering is rapidly becoming the most important skill in AI, both for software engineers building agentic systems and for regular users trying to get the best results from large language models. The episode also includes news headlines covering Anthropic's copyright fair use ruling, the OpenAI/IO naming lawsuit, OpenAI's rumoured productivity suite, Airtable's AI-native relaunch, and ElevenLabs' new voice assistant.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and GPT-4/O3
- Understanding of what a **prompt** is and the general concept of prompt engineering
- Awareness of **AI agents** and multi-agent architectures (what they are and how they differ from single-model interactions)
- Familiarity with the concept of a **context window** in LLMs (the finite amount of text/tokens a model can process at once)
- General awareness of the current AI product landscape (Anthropic, OpenAI, LangChain, etc.)

## Main Points

### 1. The Shift from Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering

- **Prompt engineering** — the practice of crafting specific phrasings, tricks, and instructions to elicit better LLM outputs — has been the dominant paradigm since ChatGPT launched.
- As models have become more capable, older prompt engineering tricks (e.g., "I'll pay you $100 if you get this right") have become less effective and less relevant.
- Increasingly, tools themselves are abstracting away prompt engineering (e.g., Ideogram expanding a short user prompt into a detailed image generation prompt automatically).
- Shopify CEO Toby Lutke articulated the shift: *"Context engineering describes the core skill better — the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solved by the LLM."*

### 2. What Context Engineering Actually Means

- **Context** refers to all information provided to an LLM that helps it answer more accurately — documents, files, instructions, tool outputs, retrieved data, etc.
- Using the operating system analogy (credited to Andrej Karpathy): the LLM is like a CPU, and its **context window is like RAM** — working memory for the model.
- Context enters an LLM through multiple channels:
  - **Prompts** (user instructions)
  - **Retrieval** (documents, databases)
  - **Tool calls** (APIs, external services)
- Context engineering is the discipline of **packaging and managing** what goes into that working memory so the model can perform a task reliably.

### 3. Context Engineering in Multi-Agent and Agentic Systems

- A post by Cognition (creators of the Devin coding agent), titled *"Don't Build Multi-Agents,"* illustrates the core challenge of context in agentic systems.
- In a typical multi-agent architecture, a task is broken into subtasks and handed to separate sub-agents; a coordinating agent then combines the results.
- **The problem:** context is lost or corrupted in transmission between agents. Example given:
  - Task: *"Build a Flappy Bird clone"*
  - Sub-agent 1 misinterprets and builds a Super Mario Bros. background
  - Sub-agent 2 builds a bird that doesn't resemble a Flappy Bird game asset
  - The coordinating agent must reconcile two miscommunications
- Cognition's proposed alternative: a **single-threaded linear agent** that handles all subtasks sequentially, preserving continuous context throughout.
- For very large tasks where context windows overflow, one proposed architecture is a **side-long context compression LLM** that compresses conversation history and key decisions into a summary, which then informs subsequent subtasks.

### 4. Industry Recognition of Context Engineering as a Core Discipline

- A LangChain blog post titled *"The Rise of Context Engineering"* defines it as: *"building dynamic systems to provide the right information and tools in the right format such that the LLM can plausibly accomplish the task."*
- The post argues that **most agent failures** are attributable not to model inadequacy but to the model not receiving appropriate context, instructions, and tools.
- As models improve, the proportion of failures attributable to context (rather than raw capability) increases.
- Cognition has stated that **context engineering is effectively the number one job of engineers building AI agents.**
- Anthropic noted that *"agents often engage in conversations spanning hundreds of turns, requiring careful context management strategies."*

### 5. Three Strategies for Managing Context (Technical Layer)

From a LangChain/Lance Martin blog post, *"Context Engineering for Agents"*:

- **Curating context:** Managing which tokens an agent sees at each turn — not dumping everything indiscriminately.
- **Persisting context:** Building systems to store, save, and retrieve context over time across long interactions.
- **Isolating context:** Partitioning context across agents or environments to prevent interference and information overload.

> Note: The host flags this as early-stage work, with general principles still being established.

### 6. Context Engineering for Everyday Users (Not Just Engineers)

- Just as prompt engineering became a skill for general LLM users, context engineering is likely to become an important discipline for non-technical users as well.
- Key user-facing questions include:
  - How much information should I give a model for a given task?
  - Which models handle large volumes of context better?
- Example: A *Latent Space* piece titled *"God Is Hungry for Context"* highlighted that **OpenAI's O3 Pro** significantly outperformed O3 when given large volumes of company-specific context (past meeting notes, recorded audio), producing a notably better strategic output.
- This points to two dimensions of user-level context engineering: **model selection** (which model is better at processing context) and **context curation** (what type and volume of context to provide).

### News Headlines Summary

*(Covered in the first segment of the episode)*

- **Anthropic copyright ruling:** A federal judge ruled AI training constitutes fair use, treating AI learning analogously to human reading. However, a separate trial will address whether Anthropic pirated ~7 million digital books, which could carry penalties of up to $150,000 per work — potentially existential for the company.
- **OpenAI/IO naming lawsuit:** Sam Altman publicly disputed Jason Rugolo's lawsuit over the "IO" name, claiming OpenAI passed on acquiring Rugolo's company before independently developing its own product under a similar name.
- **OpenAI productivity suite:** Reports suggest OpenAI has quietly designed collaborative document and communication features for ChatGPT, potentially competing with Microsoft (a major backer) and Google Workspace.
- **Airtable relaunch:** Airtable relaunched as an AI-native app platform, incorporating vibe-coding, agentic workflows, natural language app generation, and MCP integration.
- **ElevenLabs Eleven AI:** ElevenLabs launched a voice AI assistant with full MCP integration, connecting to services like Slack, Gmail, Perplexity, and Google Calendar — positioned similarly to Anthropic's recently launched voice mode assistant.

## Key Concepts

- **Context engineering:** The practice of designing and managing the information provided to an LLM so that it has what it needs — and only what it needs — to reliably complete a task.
- **Prompt engineering:** The earlier discipline of crafting specific prompt phrasings and tricks to improve LLM outputs; increasingly abstracted away by tools and diminishing in relative importance.
- **Context window:** The finite amount of text (measured in tokens) an LLM can process at one time; analogous to RAM in a computer's operating system.
- **Multi-agent architecture:** A system design where a coordinating AI agent breaks a task into subtasks and delegates them to specialised sub-agents, whose outputs are then combined.
- **Single-threaded linear agent:** An alternative architecture proposed by Cognition where one agent handles all subtasks sequentially, maintaining continuous context throughout.
- **Context compression LLM:** A side-channel model that summarises the history of a long agentic conversation into key moments and decisions, enabling context to be carried forward without overflowing the context window.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) / retrieval:** A method of supplying an LLM with relevant external documents or database content as part of its context at query time.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** A protocol enabling AI assistants to connect to and pull data from external services and tools (referenced in the context of ElevenLabs and Airtable).
- **O3 Pro:** OpenAI's reasoning model variant described as particularly optimised for processing large volumes of context.
- **Fair use (AI copyright):** A legal doctrine being tested in courts to determine whether using copyrighted works to train AI models constitutes permissible transformative use rather than infringement.

## Summary

The episode argues that **context engineering** — the discipline of deliberately managing what information is given to an LLM and how it is packaged — is emerging as the defining skill of the current AI era, superseding prompt engineering in importance. The host traces the concept from Shopify CEO Toby Lutke's framing of it as "the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solved by the LLM," through technical discussions in posts from Cognition and LangChain, to practical implications for everyday users. At the engineering level, context management is already the central challenge in building reliable agentic systems — determining how context is preserved, compressed, and transmitted across complex multi-step workflows. At the user level, knowing how much context to provide and which models handle it best is becoming as consequential as knowing how to write a good prompt. The host concludes that context engineering is likely to be "every bit, if not more important than prompt engineering" in shaping how people and organisations get value from AI systems going forward.
