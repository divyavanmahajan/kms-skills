# Google Cloud Next 2025: All About Agents

## Overview

This episode of the *AI Daily Brief* (hosted by Nathaniel Whittemore, though not explicitly named in this transcript) covers the major announcements from Google Cloud Next 2025, held in Las Vegas, alongside four supporting headlines: Anthropic's new premium subscription tier, NVIDIA's chip export carve-out, Andreessen Horowitz's proposed $20B AI fund, and OpenAI's countersuit against Elon Musk. The central thesis is that Google Cloud Next was comprehensively organized around agentic AI infrastructure, signaling that the industry has moved decisively from model benchmarking toward practical, deployable AI agents.

## Main Points

### Anthropic Launches "Claude Max" Premium Subscription

- Anthropic introduced a high-usage subscription tier called **Claude Max**, targeting power users frustrated by rate limits on the existing $20/month Pro tier.
- Two price points: **$100/month** (5× the Pro rate limit) and **$200/month** (20× the Pro rate limit).
- Unlike OpenAI's $200/month tier, Claude Max does **not** offer unlimited usage.
- Anthropic's product lead Scott White indicated the company may introduce even higher tiers (e.g., $500/month), guided by user feedback.
- The move mirrors OpenAI's precedent and reflects a clear market signal that power users are willing to pay significantly more for reliable, high-volume access.

### NVIDIA Secures Carve-Out on China H20 Chip Export Restrictions

- Widely anticipated export restrictions on NVIDIA's **H20 chips** (downgraded GPUs designed to comply with existing controls) were not implemented following a dinner between Jensen Huang and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.
- In exchange, Huang reportedly promised new U.S. data center investment.
- China officially accounts for **13% of NVIDIA's revenue**, potentially much higher when accounting for indirect exports through Southeast Asia.
- Semiconductor historian Chris Miller noted H20 chips still outperform most Chinese domestic chips despite performance reductions.
- Recent reports of efficient training on Huawei chips introduce some uncertainty, but China remains critically reliant on NVIDIA imports.
- The episode reinforces the perception that there is no coherent U.S. chip export strategy, and that deal-making influences policy outcomes.

### Andreessen Horowitz Reportedly Pursuing $20B AI Mega Fund

- A16Z is reportedly raising a **$20 billion AI-focused fund**, significantly larger and more concentrated than its previous $7.2B raise spread across multiple themes.
- Motivation partly includes capitalizing on international LP demand for exposure to U.S. AI companies amid tariff-related investment friction.
- Comparison to SoftBank's Vision Fund ($100B, 2017) raises questions about whether VC can scale effectively at this size.
- A significant portion is intended for **follow-on investments** in existing portfolio companies such as Mistral, Safe Superintelligence, and Databricks.
- Historical context: AI's capital intensity has already exceeded traditional VC capacity, which is why companies like OpenAI originally turned to Microsoft.

### OpenAI Countersues Elon Musk

- OpenAI filed a countersuit against Elon Musk, seeking to halt what it calls "unlawful and unfair" actions and hold him financially liable for damage caused.
- OpenAI's filing characterized Musk's recent acquisition bid as a "fake takeover bid designed to disrupt" its operations.
- Musk's attorneys responded that OpenAI's board failed to seriously consider the bid as legally required.
- A **jury trial is scheduled for spring 2026**; Musk's earlier injunction attempt to halt OpenAI's nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion was rejected in March 2025.
- OpenAI has a strong financial incentive to resolve this quickly: **$10 billion from SoftBank** in its latest round is contingent on completing the conversion by end of 2025.

### Google Cloud Next: MCP Adoption Confirmed

- Following OpenAI's earlier support for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis confirmed Gemini models and SDK will also support MCP.
- This means all three leading U.S. AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) now support MCP.
- MCP functions as a protocol for agent-to-tool and agent-to-data interactions, enabling more plug-and-play agent construction.
- Broader MCP adoption accelerates interoperability across the agentic infrastructure layer and compounds development across labs and companies.

---

### Google Announces Agent Development Kit and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

- Google unveiled its **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and an interoperability standard called **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)**.
- A2A governs how agents communicate with *each other*, as opposed to MCP which governs how agents interact with tools and data.
- Google VP Rausur Apaneni positioned A2A as a **higher layer of abstraction** complementary to, not competing with, MCP:
  - MCP: LLM ↔ tools/data
  - A2A: agent ↔ agent coordination and communication
- **50 companies** support A2A at launch, including Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Workday.
- Expert commentary (MIT PhD Tobin South, HubSpot founder Dharmesh Shah) noted:
  - A2A addresses genuine needs: capability discovery, async tasks, human-in-the-loop UX
  - The protocol is heavier than MCP, which may slow grassroots adoption
  - Likely optimized for Fortune 1000 multi-agent deployments within enterprises rather than cross-organizational agent communication
  - Consensus: good progress, but not an MCP-level adoption event

### Gemini 2.5 Flash: Efficient Reasoning Model

- Google released **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, a smaller, low-latency model designed for high-volume, cost-sensitive applications.
- Key feature: tunable balance of speed, accuracy, and cost for specific use cases.
- Launched as a **reasoning model** with dynamic depth adjustment based on prompt complexity — a similar approach to OpenAI's reasoning model strategy.
- Positioned as likely the **cheapest reasoning model on the market** at launch.
- Ideal use cases cited: responsive virtual assistants, real-time summarization tools.
- Google also announced plans to bring Gemini models to **on-premise deployments** starting Q3 2025.

### Ironwood: Google's 7th-Generation TPU

- Google announced **Ironwood**, the seventh generation of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), purpose-built for AI inference (not training).
- Key claims:
  - **24× the computing power** of the world's fastest supercomputer at full-scale deployment
  - Approximately **2× faster than NVIDIA's H100**
  - **4× increase** in compute vs. previous generation (Trillium, 2024)
  - **2× improvement in performance per watt** vs. Trillium
- Largest deployable pod: **9,216 chips**, compared to NVIDIA Blackwell B200's maximum of 576 chips before requiring external networking — a significant architectural scaling advantage.
- The inference-only focus aligns with the computational demands of reasoning models and agent-driven workloads.
- Notable endorsement: **Ilya Sutskever's startup** (Safe Superintelligence) announced it will use Google Cloud TPUs.

---

### Other Announcements

- **Gemini Code Assist** received an agentic upgrade, enabling multi-step programming task automation (competing with Cursor).
- Google launched a **security agent** within a unified security platform; endorsed by Charles Schwab's CISO for proactive threat remediation.
- **Samsung** announced Gemini integration into its new home robot.
- Google's enterprise cloud platform added a **music generation model**.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** An open standard governing how AI agents interact with external tools and data sources; now supported by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A):** Google's proposed interoperability protocol governing communication and task coordination between AI agents, positioned as a higher-level complement to MCP.
- **Agent Development Kit (ADK):** Google's software toolkit for building AI agents on its cloud platform.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Google's lightweight, low-latency reasoning model optimized for cost-efficient, high-volume deployment.
- **Ironwood TPU:** Google's seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit, the first optimized exclusively for inference workloads rather than training.
- **TPU (Tensor Processing Unit):** A chip architecture purpose-built for AI/ML computation, as opposed to the more general-purpose GPU.
- **Inference vs. Training:** Training = the compute-intensive process of building a model; Inference = the process of running a trained model to generate outputs. Ironwood targets inference.
- **Multi-agent systems:** Architectures in which multiple AI agents collaborate, delegate, or communicate to accomplish complex tasks.
- **Claude Max:** Anthropic's premium subscription tier offering 5× or 20× increased rate limits over the standard Pro plan.
- **H20 chip:** NVIDIA's performance-reduced GPU variant designed to comply with U.S. export controls while remaining competitive in the Chinese market.

## Summary

Google Cloud Next 2025 marked a clear industry inflection point: the conversation has shifted from which foundation model scores highest on benchmarks to how AI agents can be built, deployed, and coordinated reliably at scale. Google's most consequential announcements — MCP adoption, the Agent-to-Agent protocol, the Agent Development Kit, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and the Ironwood TPU — form a coherent stack aimed at making agentic AI infrastructure more interoperable, more efficient, and more deployable in enterprise environments. The surrounding headlines reinforce the same theme of an industry maturing rapidly: premium pricing tiers for power users, massive new VC funds targeting AI, geopolitical maneuvering around AI chips, and high-stakes legal battles over AI governance all point to a sector that is no longer in an experimental phase, but is instead competing intensely over who will control the infrastructure and platforms that the next era of AI runs on.
