# Agent Skills Masterclass – Study Document

## Overview
This talk is a practical deep-dive masterclass on building, deploying, and managing AI agent skills. It is presented by **Nufar Gaspar**, in conversation with the host of the **AI Daily Brief** podcast. The session builds on a prior introductory "skills primer" episode and is intended as a hands-on operator playbook. The central thesis is that agent skills — portable, human-readable instruction folders — are the foundational primitive of the emerging AI agent era, and that individuals and organizations who invest in building high-quality skill libraries will see compounding productivity and capability gains.

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with AI chat tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, etc.)
- General understanding of what AI agents and agentic workflows are
- Awareness of prompt engineering concepts (system prompts, custom GPTs, Gems)
- Familiarity with markdown file format and basic folder/file structures
- Some exposure to the concept of agent skills (the prior AI Daily Brief "skills primer" episode is recommended as a foundation)

---

## Main Points

### What Agent Skills Are
- Skills are **folders** (not just single files) containing instructions, scripts, and resources that give AI agents and tools an actionable playbook for executing specific tasks.
- Skills operate in two modes:
  - **Agent-discovered**: the agent autonomously detects and invokes the relevant skill from the enabled environment.
  - **Human-triggered**: the user invokes a skill via slash commands or verbal cues (e.g., saying "research this topic" fires a custom research skill).
- Skills are **highly portable** — stored as human-readable files with no proprietary format, moveable between tools, and editable by anyone without an engineering background.

### Why Skills Are the Future Standard
- Approximately 44 tools already support skills and the number grows daily; includes Claude (Anthropic), OpenAI's ecosystem, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub, Notion, and others.
- Skills solve the key limitation of custom GPTs and Gems: those were **locked to a single platform**; skills travel with you.
- Skills that come from third-party marketplaces (e.g., Anthropic's skills repo, OpenClaude marketplace) should be **treated like installing third-party software** — read carefully, verify the source, and be cautious about permissions they may invoke.

### When to Build a Skill
- Strong signals to build a skill:
  - You do something **more than three times**.
  - You keep **pasting the same instructions** repeatedly.
  - You need **consistent output** across uses or users.
- Additional motivations:
  - Standardizing how work is done across a team.
  - Unlocking tasks you previously lacked the bandwidth or know-how to accomplish.
- **One skill per task** — if a skill is trying to do multiple separate jobs, split it into separate skills.
- Building your own skills is recommended over copying from marketplaces, especially early on, because it develops the foundational capability; downloaded skills can still serve as templates rather than wholesale copies.

### Anatomy of an Effective Skill
A well-constructed skill should include:

1. **Trigger** — the most critical element; precise wording for when the skill should fire. Be explicit and loud rather than subdued; models may skip past weak triggers.
2. **Body (steps)** — written as numbered steps or bullet lists, not prose. Structured instructions become the agent's literal action plan.
3. **Level of freedom calibration** — be prescriptive for fragile/precise tasks (e.g., database migrations); allow creative latitude for open-ended tasks (e.g., strategy docs).
4. **Output format** — include an example output, not just a description. Show a table with headers, a document section structure, etc.
5. **Gotcha section** — highest-signal content; explicitly instructs the model where it typically goes wrong, what assumptions it should not make, and what failure modes have been observed during testing.

**What to avoid (skill killers):**
- Weak or vague triggers
- Over-defining/railroading the model (especially on creative tasks)
- Stating what the model already knows (wastes tokens)
- Skipping the gotcha section
- Monolithic single-file blobs instead of structured folders

### Skill Folder Structure Best Practices
- Keep the main skill file **under 500 lines** — it is a playbook, not an encyclopedia.
- Move reference materials and context into **separate files within the skill folder**.
- Put long input/output examples in a separate `examples.md` file inside the folder.
- Deciding what goes inside the folder vs. external pointers:
  - Context **specific to this skill** that should travel with it → put it in the skill folder.
  - General context about you or your organization → point to an external source.

### Concrete Skill Example: Meeting Prep
A more advanced skill was walked through:
- **Trigger phrases**: "prep for the meeting," "meeting prep," and several variants.
- **Bundled context**: stakeholder profiles (fixed or transient), email history, calendar data, open action items.
- **Steps**: identify attendees → collect context → analyze agenda → run scenario analysis → generate brief.
- **Output**: defined in a separate attached file due to length; includes executive summary and scenario planning sections.
- **Gotcha examples**: do not infer attendee importance from title alone; do not fabricate company details; do not skip the "what could go wrong" analysis.
- **Nested sub-skill**: a simulation skill that generates 6–7 scenarios (e.g., attendee with a hidden agenda, difficult questions, sales objections) for meeting rehearsal.

### Four Recommended Skill Ideas for Knowledge Workers
1. **Research with Confidence** — includes defined sources, time horizons, built-in fact-checking by comparing sources, and confidence scoring on findings.
2. **Devil's Advocate** — systematically stress-tests any proposal; explicitly accounts for both user blind spots and known model biases; always concludes with actionable improvements, not just critique.
3. **Morning Briefing** — pulls together priorities, calendar, pending items, and relevant news; binds personal context files (goals, projects, stakeholders) to the skill.
4. **Board of Advisors** — simulates multiple expert archetypes (e.g., VC perspective, entrepreneur perspective, domain expert) to provide diverse advisory perspectives on any decision.

### Advanced Skill Patterns
- **Dispatcher (meta-skill)**: a skill that reads all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate skill. Recommended once you have more than 10–15 active skills, especially when skills have nuanced overlaps.
- **Skill chaining**: connect skills sequentially — manually (take output of one as input to next) or automatically (a skill that calls the next skill). Requires clean, well-defined inputs and outputs at each stage.
  - *Example chain*: Research with Confidence → Devil's Advocate → Executive Summary/Deck Preparation.
- **Agentic loops**: skills that iterate in a check-act-check cycle. Example: a marketing campaign optimization loop that monitors ad performance, adjusts bids, checks metrics, and runs competitive analysis continuously.
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: skills that explicitly spin up multiple sub-agents to execute tasks in parallel.

### Testing and Maintenance of Skills
- **Primary test**: if you find yourself iterating on the output after a skill runs, the skill is not yet good enough. A well-built skill should produce a ready-to-use output.
- **Evaluation rigor should match stakes**: skills that touch CRMs, customer-facing outputs, or critical workflows require formal evaluation processes.
- **Re-evaluate when**: a new model is released, a new tool adopts the skill, approximately one month has passed, or when output quality declines.
- Note: sometimes the skill logic is sound but the **context files within the skill** have gone stale — that is also a common cause of degrading results.
- Skills that are no longer relevant should be **deprecated** to prevent accumulation of a stale library.

### Organizational Skill Libraries
- Forward-thinking organizations are treating skills the way they treat code: maintained in shared libraries, with clear ownership, versioning, and deprecation policies.
- **Recommended organizational workflow**:
  1. **Discovery** — run work audits; identify repetitive tasks, AI underperformance areas, and wish lists.
  2. **Build** — use best practices or tools like Anthropic's skill creator.
  3. **Validate** — cross-validate: have one person stress-test another person's skill; treat shared skills like AI products with proper evaluation.
  4. **Package** — bundle skills and relevant context into plugins or reusable components deployable per department or team.
  5. **Maintain** — assign clear owners (AI champions or subject matter experts); schedule reviews; deprecate stale skills.
- Anthropic's Claude for Work already supports plugins composed of skills and context, deployable org-wide to give all users a consistent shared capability baseline.
- **Skill hackathons** are one mechanism organizations are using to bootstrap team-level skill libraries.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent Skill**: A portable folder containing instructions, scripts, and resources that give an AI agent or tool an actionable playbook for a specific task.
- **Trigger**: The section of a skill file that specifies exactly when and how the skill should be activated, either by an agent automatically or by a human verbal/command cue.
- **Gotcha Section**: A dedicated section in a skill that explicitly lists the failure modes, wrong assumptions, and error patterns the model should avoid — considered the highest-signal content in any skill.
- **Dispatcher Skill**: A meta-skill that reads incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate skill in a library; analogous to a traffic controller.
- **Skill Chaining**: The practice of connecting skills sequentially so the output of one skill becomes the input to the next, enabling multi-step automated workflows.
- **Agentic Loop**: A skill pattern where the agent iterates in a recurring check-act-recheck cycle, suitable for tasks like continuous campaign optimization.
- **Organizational Skill Library**: A shared, version-controlled repository of skills maintained at the team or company level, analogous to a code library.
- **Plugin (Claude for Work context)**: A bundled artifact combining skills and context that can be deployed across an organization so all users share the same AI capabilities.
- **Skill Deprecation**: The deliberate retirement of skills that are no longer relevant or performant, necessary to prevent a stale and unreliable skill library.

## Summary

Nufar Gaspar presents a five-level practical framework for building and managing agent skills — from understanding what they are through to designing organizational skill libraries. The core argument is that skills, as portable human-readable instruction folders, represent the foundational infrastructure primitive of the AI agent era, solving the portability and lock-in problems of earlier tools like custom GPTs. The talk emphasizes that effective skills require precise triggers, structured step-by-step bodies, calibrated creative freedom, explicit output examples, and critically a "gotcha" section documenting known failure modes. Beyond individual productivity, the larger opportunity is organizational: companies that treat skills like maintained, owned, version-controlled code assets — built through discovery, validated rigorously, packaged as plugins, and actively deprecated when stale — will achieve durable, compounding value from AI. Gaspar closes by stressing that skills are not a one-time initiative but a recurring operational practice, with roughly monthly review cycles needed to keep pace with rapidly evolving models and tools.
