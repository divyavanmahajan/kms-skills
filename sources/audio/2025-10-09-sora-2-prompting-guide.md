# Sora 2 Prompting Guide & AI Business Applications

## Overview
This episode of **AI Daily Brief** (hosted by Nathaniel Whittemore, though the host is not explicitly named in this transcript) covers two primary subjects: a practical guide to prompting OpenAI's Sora 2 video generation model, drawing directly from OpenAI's official Sora 2 Cookbook prompting guide, and five business use cases for Sora. The episode also includes headline news covering Cursor's Plan Mode, NVIDIA's AI coding adoption, Google's Gemini 2.5 computer use model, Anthropic's IBM partnership, and XAI's Grok Imagine update.

The Sora 2 content matters because the model is newly available via API, rapidly gaining users, and represents a practical shift in how video content can be produced for business and creative purposes.

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with AI text-to-video generation concepts
- General understanding of prompt engineering principles
- Awareness of OpenAI's product ecosystem (ChatGPT, Codex, Sora)
- Familiarity with video production terminology (camera setups, grading, shot lists) is helpful for the advanced prompting section
- Basic understanding of content marketing and UGC (user-generated content) for the business use case sections

## Main Points

### Cursor Introduces Plan Mode
- Plan Mode allows Cursor's coding agent to create structured plans, research the codebase, ask clarifying questions, and memorialise the final plan in an editable markdown file before executing.
- The feature exemplifies a broader theme: **context is king** in advanced AI use; planning lets the agent collaboratively build context with the user before acting.
- NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang confirmed that 100% of NVIDIA's engineers now use AI coding assistants, citing Cursor specifically and noting significant productivity gains.
- AnySphere (Cursor's maker) is fielding investment at a **$30 billion valuation**, more than triple its June 2025 valuation, partly driven by the unique ground-level usage data Cursor accumulates.

### Other AI Headlines
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Computer Use**: Optimised for human-focused interfaces (web browsers); currently limited to web browsing only, unlike OpenAI and Anthropic equivalents; available via API.
- **Google CodeMender**: A code security agent that has autonomously upstreamed 72 security fixes to open-source projects, some with codebases up to 4.5 million lines.
- **Anthropic + IBM Partnership**: Claude models integrated into IBM's IDE, with enterprise education on MCP servers; follows Anthropic's announcement of a 470,000-worker deployment at Deloitte.
- **XAI Grok Imagine 0.9**: Upgraded image-to-video model with native audio and dialogue generation; made free and integrated directly into X (Twitter); competitive with but not yet consistently equal to Sora 2.

### Sora 2 Context and Adoption
- Sora hit **1 million app downloads in under five days**, faster than ChatGPT's initial growth.
- Approaching **500,000 daily active users**; retention is the open question, hinging on whether remix/interactive features differentiate it from existing short-form video apps.
- Sora 2 and Sora 2 Pro are now available via **API**, enabling automated workflows and third-party integrations (e.g., Pika, Higgs Field, InVideo).
- Societal concerns include easy watermark removal and unresolved copyright questions around IP used in training.

### Business Use Cases for Sora

#### 1. Product Design Prototyping
- OpenAI showcased Mattel using Sora to turn concept art into video prototypes of new toy designs (e.g., car track environments), avoiding the cost of physical prototyping.
- Applicable beyond large companies: independent creators on platforms like Etsy can visualise products before committing to production.

#### 2. Product Placement and Virtual Try-On
- Sora can place products on people or in settings to bring them to life for e-commerce.
- Example cited: users generating outfit try-on videos at approximately $1/video, enabling mass customisation for different audience niches.

#### 3. Automated UGC at Scale (API-Driven)
- Connecting Sora 2 API with workflow automation tools (e.g., N8N) enables fully automated UGC video pipelines.
- Example workflow: input a single product photo → generate 50+ HD videos with commercial rights → cost of a few dollars versus ~$10,000/month for influencer content.
- Targets e-commerce brands and creative agencies scaling content production.

#### 4. Startup Launch Video and A/B Testing ("Doctor Strange Approach")
- Instead of paying a video agency $10K+ and waiting weeks, teams can generate 100+ launch video variations, test all angles within 48 hours, identify what converts, and ship organic content daily.
- The host refers to this as the **"Doctor Strange approach"**: agents executing tasks at scale (hundreds or thousands of iterations) and testing against real or synthetic audiences to find what works empirically rather than by guessing.

#### 5. Content Creation on the Sora Platform Itself
- Sora as a new distribution platform offers early-mover advantages for content creators willing to invest before the network matures.
- Three sub-categories identified:
  - **Educational explainers**: Short AI-narrated videos explaining concepts (e.g., reinforcement learning, context engineering).
  - **News briefs**: Short animated news clips (example shown from AIDB collaborator Dracuez).
  - **Unhinged small business commercials**: Surreal, entertaining branded videos that can be cross-posted to other networks.

### Sora 2 Prompting Guide: Open vs. Descriptive Prompts
- A fundamental choice governs all Sora prompting: **how much creative control to give the model**.
- **Short/open prompts** give the model creative freedom and produce more surprising results; useful when the creator lacks a fully formed vision.
  - Example of a minimal but effective prompt: *"In a 90s documentary-style interview, an old Swedish man sits in a study and says, 'I still remember when I was young.'"*
  - This prompt specifies style, subject, setting, and dialogue — but leaves time of day, weather, outfits, tone, camera angles, and set design to the model.
- **Ultra-detailed prompts** are appropriate for cinematic or precise marketing requirements.

### Sora 2 Prompting Guide: The Unit Structure for Mid-Level Prompts
- OpenAI recommends thinking of each shot as its own **unit** when composing prompts with multiple shots.
- Each unit should ideally contain **one of each** of the following elements:

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Style reference | Sets overall vibe/era | "90s documentary", "1980s educational video" |
| Camera setup | Framing and camera type | Wide shot, close-up, handheld |
| Subject action | What the subject does (one action only) | Sits, walks, turns |
| Camera move | Movement of the camera (one move only) | Slow push-in, pan left |
| Lighting recipe | Source and quality of light | Natural sunlight from camera left, low angle |
| Dialogue or sound | Spoken lines or audio/music cues | Lyrics, dialogue, ambient sound description |

- Multiple units can be chained in a single prompt to create a sequence, but each unit should remain internally focused.
- Including **specific timestamps** in a shot list significantly improves model adherence to the intended structure.

### Sora 2 Prompting Guide: Ultra-Detailed / Cinematic Prompts
- For complex cinematic shots, prompts can include professional production specifications before the shot list:
  - **Format and look** (e.g., "Digital capture emulating 65mm photochemical contrast")
  - **Lenses and filtration**
  - **Grade and palette** (highlights, mids, blacks)
  - **Lighting and atmosphere**
  - **Location and framing** (foreground, midground, background breakdowns)
  - **Negative prompts** (e.g., "avoid signage or corporate branding")
  - **Wardrobe, props, and extras**
  - **Sound**
  - **Timestamped shot list**
- This approach is analogous to how a director briefs a camera crew or VFX team.
- **Practical suggestion from the host**: Feed the OpenAI sample ultra-detailed prompt into a reasoning model (e.g., GPT-4o or GPT-5 thinking), ask it to generate a template, then describe your video in plain language and let the AI populate the technical fields (e.g., lighting bounce, lens choice).

### Key Takeaways from the Prompting Guide
- **Style references are high-leverage**: specifying an era, genre, or documentary style quickly anchors the model to the intended aesthetic and can substitute for extensive technical description.
- **There is no such thing as too much specificity** when you have a precise vision: the model can handle professional-level production language.
- For most practical use cases, the **unit structure** (style + camera + action + move + lighting + sound) strikes the right balance between creative guidance and model flexibility.

## Key Concepts

- **Sora 2**: OpenAI's second-generation text-to-video model, available as a standalone app and via API, capable of generating high-quality video from text or image prompts.
- **Plan Mode (Cursor)**: A feature in the Cursor AI coding tool that lets the agent research a codebase, draft a plan collaboratively with the user, and memorialise it in a markdown file before executing.
- **Context engineering**: The practice of carefully structuring the information (who, what, where, when) provided to an AI model to improve output quality; distinguished from simple prompting.
- **Doctor Strange approach**: A framework for agentic AI work in which agents execute a task hundreds or thousands of times in parallel, test outputs against real or synthetic audiences, and surface what works empirically — rather than producing a single output.
- **UGC (User-Generated Content)**: Informal video content that mimics organic, creator-style media; increasingly generated programmatically via video AI APIs for marketing purposes.
- **Unit structure (prompting)**: OpenAI's recommended framework for structuring Sora prompts, where each shot is described as a self-contained unit with one style reference, camera setup, subject action, camera move, lighting recipe, and sound/dialogue cue.
- **Negative prompts**: Instructions to a generative AI model specifying what to exclude from the output (e.g., "avoid corporate branding").
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**: A protocol for managing context in enterprise AI agent deployments; referenced in the Anthropic-IBM partnership for enterprise education.
- **Computer use models**: AI systems that interact with computers via graphical interfaces (browsers, desktops) the way humans do; examples include Google Gemini 2.5 computer use, OpenAI's computer use, and Anthropic's computer use.
- **Grok Imagine**: XAI's image-to-video generation platform, updated to version 0.9 with native audio/dialogue generation and integrated into the X social network.

## Summary

The episode argues that AI video generation — exemplified by Sora 2 — has crossed a practical threshold where it is now both accessible enough and capable enough to support real business workflows, not just creative experimentation. The host synthesises OpenAI's official Sora 2 prompting guide into an actionable framework, distinguishing between short open-ended prompts (which grant the model creative latitude), mid-level unit-structured prompts (which balance guidance and flexibility), and ultra-detailed cinematic prompts (which mirror professional production briefs). Running through all of the business use cases — product prototyping, virtual try-on, automated UGC pipelines, launch video A/B testing, and platform-native content creation — is a unifying idea the host calls the "Doctor Strange approach": the real power of AI video is not in replacing one video with one AI video, but in generating orders of magnitude more content, testing it at scale, and letting empirical performance data replace guesswork. The same theme of context and specificity driving AI quality surfaces in the headline coverage of Cursor's Plan Mode, reinforcing a cross-domain principle: the more deliberately structured the input to an AI system, the more reliable and useful the output.
