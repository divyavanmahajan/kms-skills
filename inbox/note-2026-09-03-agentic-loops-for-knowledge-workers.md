# Agentic Loops for Knowledge Workers: Study Guide

## Overview

**Central Thesis:** This webinar, recorded September 3, 2026, explores how knowledge workers can move beyond one-shot prompting to designing autonomous agent systems using loops and work graphs. Rather than telling AI tools what to do, users can set measurable end goals and let agents iterate until tasks are complete, then orchestrate multiple agents into teams when single-agent execution falls short.

**Speakers:** Nufar Gaspar and Nathaniel Labenz, presenting as part of the AI Daily Brief podcast and webinar series.

**Why It Matters:** As of August 2026, major AI vendors reported that usage shifted from "assisted" (single-prompt chat) to "agentic" (multi-turn autonomous execution). Users employing these techniques are pulling away from the average in token efficiency and work quality. For knowledge workers, this represents a fundamental shift in how work gets delegated—from instructions to managing autonomous agents.

## Prerequisites

- **AI/LLM Literacy:** Familiarity with large language models (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and how prompting works
- **Agentic Tool Experience:** Practical use of at least one tool with agent/loop capabilities (Claude's `/goal` command, ChatGPT's work mode, Cursor's `/loop`, or similar)
- **Basic Software Concepts:** Understanding of loops, iterations, and conditional logic from programming
- **Workflow Thinking:** Ability to map multi-step processes and identify dependencies between tasks
- **Verification Mindset:** Comfort with defining measurable success criteria and quality rubrics

## Main Points

### 1. **The Evolution from Prompting to Graph Engineering**

- The field has progressed through five eras: **prompt engineering** (what you say) → **context engineering** (what the model knows) → **harness engineering** (where it runs, what tools it accesses) → **loop engineering** (how long it runs autonomously) → **graph engineering** (how many agents work together)
- Each evolution gives AI more independence at a bigger scale
- This is not merely a naming shift; it reflects real maturity in how reliably agents can execute complex, multi-step work
- OpenAI's usage data (April–May 2026) showed a crossover: majority token consumption moved from assisted to agentic paradigm

### 2. **What Is a Loop? (And Why It's Not a Schedule)**

- Every agentic tool already runs a native loop under the hood: **plan → act (using tools) → check results → adjust**
- That native loop is generic and built by tool vendors; users cannot easily customize when/how it stops
- An **extended loop** (created via `/goal`, `/loop`, or `slash goal` command) lets users specify a concrete, verifiable end goal and force the agent to keep iterating until that goal is met
- **Critical distinction:** A *schedule* answers "when" (clock time or event trigger); a *loop* answers "until" (when a condition is satisfied)
- Loops stop based on progress toward a goal, not elapsed time—they may run 10 minutes or 2 hours depending on work complexity

### 3. **The Loop-Coding Asymmetry: Why Knowledge Work Is Harder**

- Loops were invented by and for software engineers, who have abundant, built-in **verification**: code compiles or it doesn't; tests pass or fail
- Knowledge work typically lacks this built-in referee: *Is this report good enough to present to management? Is this analysis deep enough?* No compiler answers these
- The central challenge: **Users must design the referee themselves**—define what "done" means in concrete, machine-checkable terms
- If you cannot define a clear finish line, do not loop the task; a single-agent conversation is the right choice instead

### 4. **Criteria for Loop-Worthy Tasks**

A task deserves a loop only if it meets **all** of these:

- **Long-running:** One prompt + response is not enough; the task benefits from multiple iterations
- **Checkable progress:** You can verify whether results are good enough or headed in the right direction (this is the hardest criterion for knowledge work)
- **Autonomous runtime:** The work is suitable for overnight or background execution; you don't need to babysit it
- **Convergent:** More iterations get you closer to done; there's a natural stopping point
- **Pushes model capability:** You tried it with your best available model (Opus, Sonnet, etc.) on a single shot and results were insufficient

Avoid loops for:
- Short, one-shot tasks (e.g., "summarize this email in one line")
- Tasks requiring irreducible human judgment (hiring, strategy, executive communication)
- Work where you cannot define a concrete finish line
- Token-intensive work unless the value clearly justifies the cost

### 5. **Designing a Goal Card (The Finish Line)**

The skill that separates effective loops from failed ones is defining the **goal card**—the specification that tells the agent what "done" looks like.

A complete goal card contains:

1. **Concrete, clear objective:** "Create the definitive token efficiency playbook as of August 2026" (not "make it good" or "make it insightful")
2. **Output format:** What deliverable does success produce? (file, JSON, report, etc.)
3. **Success criteria (stopping conditions):** Specific, machine-verifiable conditions
   - Example: "At least 200 unique data points, each with URL and publication date"
   - Example: "Every claim cited with a source; zero duplications"
   - Example: "Mix of: 40+ vendor docs, 40+ practitioner perspectives, 20+ benchmarks"
4. **Optional: Stages/gates:** Specify intermediate actions or checks (e.g., "research phase, then synthesis phase")
5. **Failsafes/caps:** Always include at least one hard stop to prevent infinite loops
   - Maximum turns/iterations (e.g., "stop after 30 cycles")
   - Time limit (e.g., "max 2 hours")
   - Budget cap (e.g., "max 500k tokens")

**Example from the webinar:** Research loop for token efficiency practices:
- Goal: "Artifact contains executive summary + detailed data file"
- Criteria: "200+ unique data points, each with URL, date, and type; zero duplicates; specific source mix"
- Cap: "30 turns maximum; sandbox only (no external API calls outside Claude's available tools)"

### 6. **Common Loop Failures and How to Prevent Them**

- **Runaway spend:** Loop consumes tokens indefinitely or much longer than expected
  - *Prevention:* Always add hard caps (max turns, time limit, token budget)
- **Stack without progress:** Loop repeats cycles without converging on the goal
  - *Prevention:* Test the goal card on a single shot first; if convergent, keep it; if not, redefine the finish line
- **Mediocre mediocre results:** Loop meets the letter of the goal but delivers bland output
  - *Prevention:* This signals a weak goal card—add quality rubrics or refine what "done" means (e.g., "summary must identify 3+ novel insights")
- **Looping the wrong task:** Task was not loop-worthy to begin with
  - *Prevention:* Apply the loop-worthiness checklist before invoking `/goal`

### 7. **From Loops to Graphs: When One Agent Isn't Enough**

As work complexity grows, users graduate through stages:

1. **Single agent, single execution:** One agent, one-shot response (traditional chat)
2. **Single agent with loop:** One agent, runs autonomously until goal is met
3. **Work graph (acyclic):** Multiple agents, each handling one task, passing results between them
4. **Org graph (persistent):** Standing team of agents that collaborate across many requests

**Key insight:** A loop is the simplest graph—a single node with an edge pointing back to itself.

**When to add more agents (move to a graph):**

- **Rubber stamp problem:** The agent keeps missing issues that should have been caught (self-review is unreliable; different models/perspectives catch more)
- **Context overflow:** One agent is wearing too many hats and getting confused (e.g., trying to be both objective researcher and creative designer)
- **Parallelizable work:** Multiple independent sub-tasks can run simultaneously, reducing wall-clock time
- **Shifting finish line:** The goal keeps changing mid-run, suggesting two different jobs are hidden under one goal card
- **Quality plateau:** Despite tweaking the prompt, results flatline too soon; fresh context/perspective needed

**Do NOT graduate to graphs unless** one of these signals is present. Keeping it simple with a single agent is often the right call.

### 8. **Five Tiers of Building Graphs (Progressive Complexity)**

1. **Whiteboard sketch:** Draw the work flow on paper; take a photo and show it to an agentic tool and ask it to execute
2. **Tool-improvised graphs:** Modern tools (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT) automatically spawn sub-agents and divide work when you give them complex tasks (you don't control the structure, but it happens)
3. **Prompted graphs:** Describe the graph in natural language to the tool
   - Example: "Research these five competitors in parallel with separate sub-agents. Then have a fresh-context reviewer check the merged results against this rubric."
4. **Persistent workers + skills:** Create reusable sub-agents (e.g., "Citation Verifier," "Benchmark Collector") as files or folder agents; bundle them into reusable skills
5. **Code-based orchestration:** Use frameworks like LangGraph or Python/JavaScript to build and visualize graphs programmatically

**Recommendation:** Most knowledge work lives in tiers 1–3. Tiers 4–5 are valuable for recurring, high-stakes workflows (e.g., a research synthesis pipeline run weekly).

### 9. **Anatomy of a Work Graph**

- **Nodes:** Agents or tasks (dots on the diagram)
- **Edges:** Information/work flowing between nodes (arrows; may be one-directional or bidirectional)
- **Directed graph:** Arrows point in specific directions, showing which agent consumes which agent's output
- Distinguish from: **Knowledge graphs** (store facts and relationships; used for semantic search/reasoning) and **LandGraph** (a code framework for building agent systems)

**Concrete example from webinar:**

```
[Research Loop] → [Citation Verifier] → [Report Visualizer] → [Output]
```

- Node 1: Deep research agent (runs in a loop until 200+ data points collected)
- Node 2: Independent verifier (fresh context; samples and checks URLs and source mix)
- Node 3: Formatter (turns verified data into an attractive HTML report)
- Node 4: Deliverable (final report ready for sharing)

### 10. **Six Habits of Effective Agent Orchestration**

1. **Match model to node:** Use cheaper/faster models for mechanical tasks (formatting, splitting work); stronger models (Opus) where judgment is needed
2. **Pass only relevant context between nodes:** Design a "contract" for what flows between agents
   - ✓ Correct: Pass a draft + rubric to the next agent
   - ✗ Wrong: Pass the entire conversation history
3. **Verify early and often:** Add verification nodes/gates throughout the graph, not just at the end; prevent compounding errors
4. **Spend tokens on verification:** If you fan out work to 5 parallel agents, consider summarization or capping turns per agent to keep token costs under control
5. **Keep humans in the loop:** Even if agents can execute autonomously, humans should approve at key gates (e.g., before publishing, before committing data)
6. **Don't copy human workflows:** Human work organization is constrained by human limitations (attention, time, bandwidth). Agents don't have these constraints, so don't simply automate the current process—redesign it for agent strengths
   - Example: Humans might hand off work sequentially to avoid context switching. Agents can work in parallel on separate topics without cognitive overhead.

### 11. **Concrete Use Cases for Loops in Knowledge Work**

- **Deep research:** Agent gathers data from multiple sources, synthesizes, and verifies until reaching a target threshold (e.g., 200+ data points)
- **Ad/campaign optimization:** Agent iteratively tests variations and analyzes results against KPIs (click-through rate, conversion); verifiable by real analytics
- **Competitive analysis/market scans:** Agent gathers competitor info until coverage threshold is met
- **Content audits:** Systematic review against a rubric
- **Compliance checking:** Verify that content meets standards

**Do NOT loop:**
- Hiring decisions (requires irreducible human judgment)
- Strategic planning (requires judgment; not fully automatable)
- Executive communication (requires taste/judgment about what matters to the audience)

### 12. **Practical Commands and Tools**

Different agentic tools expose loops and sub-agents through different interfaces:

- **Claude Code:** `/goal` (web/desktop) or `@subtask` (CLI only)
- **ChatGPT:** Work mode / agent mode
- **Cursor:** `/loop` command
- **Automation tools:** Make.com, n8n, Zapier support agentic work graphs via visual canvas

**Important caveat:** Commands and interfaces change frequently (deprecation, feature releases). Always consult the tool's current documentation or ask the tool for the latest commands.

## Key Concepts

- **Loop engineering:** Designing autonomous agent execution with verifiable end goals; the practice of defining what "done" means and letting agents iterate until that goal is met
- **Graph engineering:** Orchestrating multiple agents (nodes) connected by information flow (edges) to tackle complex, multi-faceted tasks
- **Agentic tool:** Software (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) that can autonomously plan, act using tools, check results, and adjust
- **Node:** An agent or task within a work graph; can be a single-pass task or a full loop
- **Edge:** The information or work flowing between nodes in a graph
- **Work graph:** A task-specific graph showing how multiple agents collaborate to complete one job
- **Org graph:** A persistent team of agents designed to handle multiple requests or ongoing responsibilities
- **Goal card:** The formal specification of what constitutes "done" for a loop, including objective, output format, success criteria, and failsafes
- **Referee (verification):** A mechanism—built by you or delegated to another agent—that checks whether work meets the finish line; essential for knowledge work loops since no built-in compiler exists
- **Loop vs. schedule:** Loop = "until done"; Schedule = "when/how often to run"
- **Finish line:** The concrete, verifiable stopping condition for a loop (e.g., "200 data points, zero duplicates, all with URLs")
- **Convergence:** The property of a task where more iterations bring you closer to done; a prerequisite for loopable work
- **Context overflow:** When one agent is asked to do too many disparate things and starts confusing them; a signal to split the work into separate agents
- **Knowledge graph:** A structured database of facts and semantic relationships; different from work graphs (not the focus of this webinar)
- **LangGraph:** A developer framework for building agent systems programmatically; one tool among many for coding graph orchestration

## Summary

As of August 2026, the state-of-the-art in AI-assisted work has evolved from single-prompt conversations to orchestrated systems of autonomous agents. Knowledge workers must master four core skills: understanding the native loops built into agentic tools, designing concrete goal cards with verifiable stopping criteria to run loops effectively, recognizing when a single agent is insufficient and designing work graphs to distribute tasks among multiple agents, and orchestrating these teams while keeping costs manageable and maintaining human oversight at critical gates. Unlike software engineering, where success is compile-time verifiable, knowledge work requires users to invent their own "referees"—criteria by which to judge whether work is done. The key insight is that loops and graphs are not exotic add-ons but fundamental primitives for how work will be delegated in the AI era; mastery requires hands-on experimentation, but the structure and best practices outlined here provide a roadmap to avoid the most common pitfalls and extract maximum value from agentic capabilities.
