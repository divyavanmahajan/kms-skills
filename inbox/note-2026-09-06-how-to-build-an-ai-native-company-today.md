# Study Document: How to Build an AI-Native Company Today

## Overview

**Central Thesis:** A year after the initial enterprise AI wave, companies are transitioning from adding AI tools onto existing processes to fundamentally redesigning workflows around agentic systems. The talk presents a framework of 30 characteristics that distinguish truly "AI-native" companies from those merely adopting AI superficially.

**Speaker & Source:** The AI Daily Brief (daily podcast and video series covering AI news and discussion). The episode draws heavily on Alex Lieberman's post "30 Features of an AI-Native Company." Lieberman is founder of 10x Labs (which helps enterprises transform into AI-native organizations) and co-founder of Morning Brew.

**Why It Matters:** As enterprises undergo significant organizational transformation driven by AI and agents, understanding what constitutes genuine AI nativeness—versus bolting AI onto legacy processes—is critical for leaders, implementers, and transformation consultants.

## Prerequisites

- **Agentic AI systems:** Understanding that agents operate autonomously with defined goals and constraints, rather than simply responding to prompts
- **Enterprise software architecture:** Familiarity with business process mapping, system integration, and organizational workflows
- **LLM capabilities and costs:** Basic knowledge of model routing, token efficiency, and the trade-offs between capability and expense across different models
- **Organizational transformation:** Awareness of how business processes change and how cultural shifts accompany technical change
- **Data management concepts:** Understanding of data sources, metadata, context management, and information architecture

---

## Main Points

### 1. Process Blueprinting (Feature 1)
- Map how work actually gets done, capturing institutional knowledge locked in individuals' heads and side conversations
- Create function-by-function process blueprints of the entire business
- **Caveat:** Process blueprints should inform agent design but not constrain agents to replicate human workflows; instead, specify goals and guardrails and let agents find optimal execution paths
- The risk is assuming agents will work exactly like humans do—they likely won't and shouldn't

### 2. Daily Driver Access (Feature 2)
- Provide everyone in the organization with access to AI work harnesses (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or custom systems)
- A "daily driver" is not just access to a frontier model, but a complete environment designed for advanced knowledge work and coding
- Emphasizes comfort with context management, skills organization, and tool access provisioning
- Organizations increasingly rolling their own harnesses (often on open-source foundations like DeepSeek) to avoid dependency lock-in

### 3. Intelligence Layer / Context Management (Feature 3)
- Aggregate structured and unstructured data, documents, and business logic into a queryable knowledge system
- Makes context available to agents for better, more informed decision-making
- The speaker prefers a "mesh or lattice" model for larger organizations rather than a single source of truth—allowing multiple sources of truth that can interface and be reconciled
- Context management will become a major organizational discipline

### 4. Model Routing (Feature 4)
- Route tasks to models optimized for cost and capability (e.g., cheaper, faster models for simple tasks; more capable models for complex reasoning)
- Part of a larger adaptable architecture designed to match task difficulty to model capability
- Not just about selecting models, but designing entire system architecture around flexibility

### 5. Context as Code (Feature 5)
- Treat context not as background information, but as the foundational code upon which agents operate
- Maintain architecture documents and conventions with diligent upfront planning as an operating discipline
- Reflects a mindset shift: AI nativeness is not just operational, but cultural

### 6. Design for Constant Change (Feature 6)
- Be willing to completely reimagine workflows every three months rather than become attached to recent solutions
- Design systems assuming change will be constant, not static
- As AI capabilities advance rapidly, yesterday's clever solution becomes obsolete; organizations must embrace continuous evolution
- Frequency of updates may be 3, 6, 9, 12 months, or continuous—but change is the baseline assumption

### 7. Skills Distribution System (Feature 7)
- Distribute reusable skills across the organization, not just isolated prompts
- Skills become a key infrastructure for agent management
- Improves token efficiency and ensures consistent behavior across workflows
- Reflects emerging discipline of centralized agent management

### 8. Separating Intent from Implementation (Feature 8)
- Keep high-level specifications separate from technical implementation
- Enables non-technical staff to contribute to product and engineering discussions without writing code themselves
- Example: Claude Tags allow teams to trigger agent workflows from shared spaces, enabling non-engineers to initiate builds
- Creates opportunities for broader organizational participation in agentic systems

### 9. Cost Per Accepted Deliverable (Feature 9)
- Track cost per accepted pull request (or analogous unit) as a key software metric
- Optimize for both completeness and cost-per-completeness, enabling fair comparison between model-harness combinations
- Metrics discipline is still emerging; organizations are still learning what to measure

### 10. Agent-Native Development (Feature 10)
- Fleets of coding agents plan, write, test, review, and ship code while humans define intent and acceptance criteria
- Increasingly inevitable but still rare in traditional organizations
- Less controversial than a year ago but represents a significant shift in development practices

### 11. Planning vs. Execution Phases (Feature 11)
- Use higher-effort (more capable, more expensive) models for planning phases
- Execute with cheaper, faster models once plans are defined
- Natural outcome of proper model routing and task architecture (Feature 4)

### 12. CLI Tools and Metadata (Feature 12)
- Use command-line tools to parse metadata in markdown files and traverse dependency relationships
- Allows agents to load only the slice of knowledge they need, not the entire corpus
- Reduces wasted context window on irrelevant information; aligns with progressive disclosure pattern in information architecture
- Drives down token costs while improving agent precision

### 13. Continuous Finance Operations (Feature 13)
- Move accounting and record-keeping toward continuous processes with tighter forecast refresh cadence
- Make financial models accessible to the broader agentic operating system for strategy and tactics design
- Requires significant mindset and technological discipline (OpenAI CFO example cited)

### 14. Citizen Developer SDLC (Feature 15)
- Enable non-technical employees to build and deploy solutions from idea to production
- Embed governance, access control, versioning, and software conventions into the process
- Reconciles work created by non-engineers with established engineering practices
- Does not replace software engineering, but creates continuity between ad-hoc tools and production systems

### 15. Self-Improving Workflows via Loop Engineering (Feature 16)
- Design workflows as loops: agents receive a goal and constraints, attempt repeatedly until goal is achieved
- Requires objective, verifiable success metrics (e.g., "achieve 95% accuracy on test") rather than subjective goals
- External performance metrics and internal evaluations drive continuous improvement
- Evals become embedded in every loop iteration

### 16. AI ROI Framework (Feature 17)
- Establish a complex ROI architecture to measure different types of AI efforts against different goals
- Organize efforts into phases (e.g., experimental, scaling, optimization) with distinct success criteria
- Allows the organization to judge diverse efforts within one unified framework

### 17. Agent Swarms for Marketing (Feature 18)
- Deploy many variations of creative work (marketing, ads, copy) via agent swarms for testing before scaling spend
- Compute constraints previously made this impractical; as costs drop and model capability increases, this becomes viable
- Reflects shift toward experimentation over intuition in creative domains
- Emerging pattern: "marketing barbell"—highly automated agentic experiments on one end, human taste-driven brand work on the other

### 18. Weekly Content Optimization (Feature 19)
- Audit, rewrite, and generate SEO/AEO-optimized articles weekly; measure results
- Broader principle: with content production cost dropping, there is room for continuous experimentation and learning
- AI-native organizations build learning systems around content to improve performance over time

### 19. AI vs. AI in Cybersecurity (Feature 20)
- Use agentic cybersecurity systems to defend against AI-powered threats
- Absolute necessity given the emergence of AI-powered attacks
- Significant policy and design challenges remain around what capabilities organizations and legitimate defenders will have access to

### 20. Fine-Tuning Open Models (Feature 21)
- Combine reinforcement learning with first-party data to fine-tune open-source models for high-volume, state-of-the-art performance at reasonable cost
- Post-trainable, customizable open-weights models near the frontier open new opportunities
- Not all organizations will roll their own models, but those with technical capability have a competitive edge
- Part of broader ecosystem where labs and hyperscalers offer multiple cost-efficiency paths

### 21. Human Sandwich Pattern (Feature 22)
- Keep humans involved at the first and final mile of most processes (input and output stages)
- Guardrail against fully autonomous systems; humans retain judgment at boundaries
- Uncertainty remains around optimal intervention points in the middle of workflows
- Some processes will run entirely agentically; patterns are still emerging

### 22. Evals as Core Infrastructure (Feature 23)
- When new models arrive, use standing apparatus to test cost and performance against core processes
- Everyone becomes an "eval builder"; evaluations become embedded throughout the organization
- Essential for loop-based workflows (Feature 15): loops cannot work without defined evaluation criteria
- Evals migrate beyond traditional ML into unexpected parts of the organization

### 23. Everyone as Builder (Feature 24)
- Make building and prototyping part of every role, especially C-level
- Not every person becomes an agent manager or coder, but capacity to build, prototype, and solve problems becomes critical
- Over time, abstraction layers will distance people from implementation details, but this doesn't reduce the need for building capability
- Both practical skill and mindset shift; implies significant organizational restructuring

### 24. Record Everything Worth Learning (Feature 25)
- Capture learning from every significant workflow and decision
- What the organization doesn't capture cannot be turned into AI-enabled work
- Drives need for more systematic meeting note-taking, documentation, and knowledge capture
- Twin to Feature 1 (blueprinting) and feeds Feature 23 (evals)

### 25. Governance as Transformation Unlock (Feature 26)
- Treat governance (legal, HR, IT) as a partner in innovation, not a blocker
- Design enabling policies that address compliance and security *while* unlocking new types of work
- Key hallmark of truly AI-native organizations vs. those bolting AI onto legacy systems
- Requires legal, HR, and IT working in lockstep with AI leadership

### 26. Self-Disruption Before Others Disrupt You (Feature 27)
- Maintain organizational bias toward disrupting yourself before competitors do
- Extends beyond process efficiency to the fundamental question of what work to do
- Much of AI transformation will be finding orthogonal, aligned opportunities AI now enables
- Requires cultural comfort with frequent change and strategic risk-taking

### 27. Guardrails Before Features (Feature 28)
- Build permissions and safeguards into the data layer, not into policy review
- Agents inherit permissions from the user requesting work; enforcement happens in data
- Reduces need to relitigate governance and access every time a new workflow is designed
- Technical twin to Feature 26 (governance as unlock)

### 28. Autonomy Must Be Earned (Feature 29)
- Agents don't start with full autonomy; they climb a ladder: observation → suggestion → acting with approval → autonomous
- Allows organization to learn and build trust incrementally
- Reduces risk of costly failures while enabling rapid capability expansion
- "Ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure" principle applied to agent autonomy

### 29. Trace Everything (Feature 30)
- Connect every output to its prompt, model, data source, and human approver
- Enables human feedback to attach to specific artifacts rather than vague complaints
- Creates comprehensive system of feedback loops that improve subsequent work
- Essential for accountability and continuous improvement

## Summary

Building a truly AI-native company requires far more than adopting AI tools; it demands systematic redesign of organizational processes, culture, and infrastructure. The 30 characteristics presented emphasize that AI-native companies share common patterns: they blueprint processes to capture institutional knowledge but refuse to constrain agents to replicate human workflows (Features 1, 6); they invest in foundational infrastructure like unified data layers, model routing, and reusable skills (Features 3, 4, 7); they embed evaluation and learning into every system (Features 15, 23, 25); they democratize building capability across the organization while maintaining clear ownership and governance (Features 8, 14, 24, 26); and they maintain a constant bias toward disrupting themselves rather than defending legacy approaches (Feature 27). The speaker emphasizes that mindset shifts—treating context as foundational code, embracing constant change, viewing governance as an enabler of innovation, and accepting that autonomy must be earned—are as critical as technical implementations. Success ultimately depends on clear ownership, measurable goals, and accountability for AI-enabled workflows, combined with organizational discipline around metrics, evaluation, and continuous improvement. The transition to AI nativeness is less about adopting specific technologies and more about building organizations designed for continuous evolution, experimentation, and learning.
